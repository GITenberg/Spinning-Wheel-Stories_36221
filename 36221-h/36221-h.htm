<h2><a name="Grandmas_Story" id="Grandmas_Story"></a>Grandma's Story</h2>

<p>"It is too bad to have our jolly vacation spoiled by
this provoking storm. Didn't mind it yesterday, because
we could eat all the time; but here we are
cooped up for a week, perhaps, and I'd like to know
what we are to do," growled Geoff, as he stood at the
window looking gloomily at the bleak scene without.
It certainly was discouraging; for the north wind
howled, the air was dark with falling snow, and drifts
were rising over fences, roads, and fields, as if to
barricade the Christmas party in the great country
house.</p>

<p>"We can bear it pleasantly, since it can't be
helped," said gentle sister Mary, with a kind hand on
his shoulder, and a face full of sympathy for his disappointment.
"I'm sorry for the coasting, skating, and
sleighing frolics we have lost; but if we must be shut
up, I'm sure we couldn't have a pleasanter prison or a
kinder jailer. Don't let grandma hear us complain,
for she has made great exertions to have our visit a
merry one, and it will trouble her if we are not gay
and contented."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's easy for a parcel of girls, who only want to
mull over the fire, and chatter, and drink tea; but it's
rough on us fellows, who come for the outside fun.
House is well enough; but when you've seen it once,
there's an end. Eating is jolly, but you can't stuff
forever. We might dig, or snowball, if it didn't blow a
gale. Never saw such a beast of a storm!"&mdash;and Geoff
flattened his nose against the window-pane and scowled
at the elements.</p>

<p>A laugh made him turn around, and forget his woes
to stare at the quaint little figure that stood curtseying
in the door-way of the keeping-room, where a dozen
young people were penned while the maids cleared up
the remains of yesterday's feast in the kitchen, the
mothers were busy with the babies upstairs, and the
fathers read papers in the best parlor; for this was a
family gathering under the roof of the old homestead.</p>

<p>A rosy, dark-eyed face looked out from the faded
green calash, a gayly flowered gown was looped up
over a blue quilted petticoat, and a red camlet cloak
hung down behind. A big reticule and a funny
umbrella were held in either hand, and red hose and
very high-heeled, pointed shoes covered a trim pair of
feet.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"God bless you, merry gentlemen!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">May nothing you dismay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here's your ancient granny come<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To call, this Christmas day,"<br /></span>
</div>

<p>sang Minnie, the lively member of the flock, as she
bobbed little curtseys and smiled so infectiously that
even cross Geoff cheered up.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that rigging?" "Isn't it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
becoming?" "What queer stuff!" "Did grandma
ever look so, I wonder?"</p>

<p>These and many other questions rained upon the
wearer of the old costume, and she answered them as
fast as she could.</p>

<p>"I went rummaging up garret for something to read,
and found two chests of old duds. Thought I'd dress
up and see how you liked me. Grandma said I might,
and told me I looked like her when she was young.
She was a beauty, you know; so I feel as proud as a
peacock." And Min danced away to stand before the
portrait of a blooming girl in a short-waisted, white-satin
gown and a pearl necklace, which hung opposite
the companion portrait of an officer in an old-fashioned
uniform.</p>

<p>"So you do. Wonder if I should look like
grandpa if I got into his old toggery!" said Geoff,
looking up at the handsome man with the queue and
the high coat-collar.</p>

<p>"Go and try; the uniform is in the chest, and not
much moth-eaten. Let's have a jolly rummage, and
see what we can find. <i>We</i> didn't eat ourselves sick,
so we will amuse these lazy invalids;" and Min
glanced pityingly at several cousins who lay about on
sofas or in easy chairs, pretending to read, but evidently
suffering from too great devotion to the bountiful
dinner and evening feast of yesterday.</p>

<p>Away went Min and Lotty, Geoff and Walt, glad of
anything to beguile the stormy afternoon. Grandma
smiled as she heard the tramp of feet overhead, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
peals of laughter, and the bang of chest-lids, well
knowing that a scene of dire confusion awaited her
when the noisy frolic was done, but thankful for the
stores of ancient finery which would keep the restless
children happy for a day.</p>

<p>It was truly a noble garret, for it extended the
whole length of the great square house, with windows
at either end, and divided in the middle by a solid
chimney. All around stood rows of chests, dilapidated
furniture, and wardrobes full of old relics, while the
walls were hung with many things for which modern
tongues can find no names. In one corner was a book-case
full of musty books and papers; in another,
kitchen utensils and rusty weapons; the third was devoted
to quilts hung on lines, and in the fourth stood a
loom with a spinning-wheel beside it, both seemingly
well cared for, as the dust lay lightly on them, and
flax was still upon the distaff.</p>

<p>A glorious rummage followed the irruption of the
Goths and Vandals into this quiet spot, and soon Geoff
quite forgot the storm as he pranced about in the buff-and-blue
coat, with a cocked hat on his head, and
grandfather's sword at his side. Lotty arrayed herself
in a pumpkin hood and quilted cloak for warmth,
while Walt, the book-worm, went straight to the ancient
library, and became absorbed in faded souvenirs,
yellow newspapers, and almanacs of a century ago.</p>

<p>Having displayed themselves below and romped all
over the house, the masqueraders grew tired at last,
and early twilight warned them to leave before ghostly
shadows began to haunt the garret.</p>

<p>"I mean to take this down and ask grandma to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
show me how it's done. I've heard her tell about
spinning and weaving when she was a girl, and I know
I can learn," said Minnie, who had fallen in love with
the little wheel, and vainly tried to twist the flax into
as smooth a thread as the one hanging from the distaff,
as if shadowy fingers had lately spun it.</p>

<p>"Queen Victoria set the fashion in England, and we
might do it here. Wouldn't it be fun to have a wheel
in the parlor at home, and really use it; not keep it
tied up with blue ribbons, as the other girls do!"
cried Lotty, charmed with the new idea.</p>

<p>"Come, Geoff, take it down for us. You ought to
do it out of gratitude for my cheering you up so
nicely," said Min, leading the way.</p>

<p>"So I will. Here, Walt, give it a hoist, and come
behind to pick up the pieces, for the old machine must
be about a hundred, I guess."</p>

<p>Shouldering the wheel, Geoff carried it down; but
no bits fell by the way, for the stout little wheel was
all in order, kept so by loving hands that for more
than eighty years had been spinning the mingled
thread of a long and useful life.</p>

<p>Glorious fires were roaring up the wide chimneys in
parlor and keeping-room, and old and young were
gathering around them, while the storm beat on the
window-panes, and the wintry wind howled as if angry
at being shut out.</p>

<p>"See what we've stolen, grandma," cried Min, as
the procession came in, rosy, dusty, gay, and eager.</p>

<p>"Bless the child! What possessed you to lug that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
old thing down?" asked Madam Shirley, much amused
as the prize was placed before her, where she sat in her
high-backed chair,&mdash;a right splendid old lady in her
stately cap, black silk gown, and muslin apron, with a
bunch of keys at her side, like a model housekeeper, as
she was.</p>

<p>"You don't mind our playing with it, do you? And
will you teach me to spin? I think it's such a pretty
little thing, and I want to be like you in all ways,
grandma dear," answered Min, sitting on the arm of
the great chair, with her fresh cheek close to the
wrinkled one where winter roses still bloomed.</p>

<p>"You wheedling gypsy! I'll teach you with all
my heart, for it is pretty work, and I often wonder
ladies don't keep it up. I did till I was too busy, and
now I often take a turn at it when I'm tired of knitting.
The hum is very soothing, and the thread much
stronger than any we get nowadays."</p>

<p>As she spoke, the old lady dusted the wheel, and
gave it a skilful turn or two, till the soft whir made
pleasant music in the room.</p>

<p>"Is it really a hundred years old?" asked Geoff,
drawing nearer with the others to watch the new
work.</p>

<p>"Just about. It was one of my mother's wedding
presents, and she gave it to me when I was fifteen.
Deary me, how well I remember that day!" and
grandma seemed to fall a-dreaming as her eyes rested
on the letters E. R. M. rudely cut in the wood, and
below these were three others with something meant
for a true lover's knot between.</p>

<p>"Whose initials are these?" asked Min, scenting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
romance with girlish quickness, for grandma was
smiling as if her eyes read the title to some little story
in those worn letters.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth Rachel Morgan, and Joel Manlius
Shirley. Your blessed grandfather cut our names
there the day I was sixteen, and put the flourish
between to show what he wanted," added the old lady,
laughing as she made the wheel hum again.</p>

<p>"Tell about it, please do," begged Min, remembering
that grandma had been a beauty and a
belle.</p>

<p>"It's a long tale, my darling, and I couldn't tell it
now. Sometime when I'm teaching you to spin I'll
do it, maybe."</p>

<p>But the girl was determined to have her story; and
after tea, when the little ones were in bed, the elders
playing whist in the parlor, and the young folks deciding
what game to begin, Minnie sat down and tried
to spin, sure that the familiar sound would lure
grandma to give the lesson and tell the tale.</p>

<p>She was right, for the wheel had not gone around
many times, when the tap of the cane was heard, and
the old lady came rustling in, quite ready for a chat,
now that three cups of her own good tea and a nap in
the chimney corner had refreshed her.</p>

<p>"No, dear, that's not the way; you need a dish of
water to wet your fingers in, and you must draw the
flax out slow and steady, else it runs to waste, and
makes a poor thread. Fetch me that chair, and I'll
show you how, since you are bent on learning."</p>

<p>Establishing herself in the straight-backed seat, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
skilful tap of the foot set the wheel in swift and easy
motion, and the gray thread twisted fine and evenly
from the distaff.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a pretty picture?" said Min to Lotty, as
they watched the old lady work.</p>

<p>"Not so pretty as the one I used to see when my
dear mother sat here, and I, a little child, at her knee.
Ah, my dears, she could have told you stories all night
long, and well worth hearing. I was never tired of
them."</p>

<p>"Please tell one now, grandma. We don't know
what to play, and it would be so nice to sit around the
fire and hear it this stormy night," suggested Min,
artfully seizing the hint.</p>

<p>"Do! Do! We all love stories, and we'll be as still
as mice," added Geoff, beckoning to the others as he
took the big arm-chair, being the oldest grandson and
leader of the flock.</p>

<p>Camping on the rug, or nestling in the sofa corner,
the boys and girls all turned expectant faces toward
grandma, who settled her cap-strings and smoothed
her spotless apron, with an indulgent smile at her little
audience.</p>

<p>"I don't know which one to tell first."</p>

<p>"The ghost story; that's a splendid one, and most
of the children never heard it," said Walt.</p>

<p>"Have Indians and fighting in it. I like that
kind," added Geoff.</p>

<p>"No; tell a love story. They are <i>so</i> interesting,"
said Lotty.</p>

<p>"I want the story about the initials first. I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
it is very sentimental. So do begin with that,
grandma," begged Min.</p>

<p>"Well, dears, perhaps I'd better choose that one,
for it has the battle of New Orleans, and wolves, and
spinning, and sweethearts in it; so it will suit you all,
I hope."</p>

<p>"Oh, lovely! Do begin right away," cried Minnie,
as the clapping of hands showed how satisfactory the
prospect was.</p>

<p>Grandma gave a loud "hem!" and began at once,
while the little wheel hummed a soft accompaniment
to her words.</p>

<h4>GRANDMA'S STORY</h4>

<p>"When I was fifteen, my mother gave me this
wheel, and said: 'Now, daughter Betsey, it is time for
you to begin your wedding outfit, for I mistrust you'll
marry young.' In those days girls spun and wove
webs of fine linen and laid 'em up in chests, with
lavender and rosemary, for sheets and table-linen after
they married. So I spun away, making all manner of
fine plans in my silly head, for I was a pretty piece,
they all said, and young as I was, two or three fine
lads used to come evenings and sit staring at me while
I worked.</p>

<p>"Among these, was my neighbor Joel Manlius
Shirley, and I was fond of him; but he hadn't much
money, so I put on airs, and tried his patience very
much.   One day he came in and said: 'Betsey, I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
going a-soldiering; they need men, and I'm off. Will
you think of poor Joe when I'm gone?'</p>

<p>"I don't know how I looked, but I felt as if I
couldn't bear it. Only I was too proud to show my
trouble; so I laughed, and gave my wheel a twist, and
said I was glad of it, since anything was better than
hanging round at home.</p>

<p>"That hurt him; but he was always gentle to saucy
Betsey, and taking out his knife, he cut those letters
under mine, saying, with a look I never could
forget:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'That will remind you of me if you are likely to
forget. Good-by; I'm going right away, and may
never come back.'</p>

<p>"He kissed me, and was off before I could say a
word, and then I cried till my flax was wet and my
thread tangled, and my heart 'most broken. Deary
me, how well I remember that heavy day!"</p>

<p>Grandma smiled, but something shone in her old
eyes very like a tear, and sentimental Lotty felt deeply
interested at this point.</p>

<p>"Where does the fighting come in?" asked Geoff,
who was of a military turn, as became the descendant
of a soldier.</p>

<p>"I didn't know or care much about the War of
1812, except as far as the safety of one man was concerned.
Joe got on without any harm till the battle of
New Orleans, when he was nearly killed behind the
cotton-bale breastworks General Jackson built."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know all about it. Jackson fought against
twelve thousand, and lost only seven men. That was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the last battle of the war, January 8, 1815. Three
cheers for grandpa!" shouted Geoff, waving a tidy, as
no hat was at hand.</p>

<p>The others echoed the hurrah, and grandma beamed
with pride as she went on: "We couldn't get news
from the army very often in those troublous times, and
Joe was gone two years before the war ended. After
the great battle we had no news for a long spell, and
we feared he was one of the seven men killed. Those
were dreadful days for all of us. My honored mother
was a pious soul, and so was Mrs. Shirley; and they
kept up their hearts with hope and prayer; but I,
poor thing, was young and weak, and I cried myself
half blind, remembering how naughty I had been. I
would spin no more, but set the wheel away, saying I
should have no need of wedding gear, as I should
never marry; and I wore black ribbon on my caps,
and one of Joe's buttons strung about my neck, mourning
dismally for my lost dear.</p>

<p>"So the winter ended, and the summer went, and no
news came of Joe. All said he was dead, and we had
prayers at church, and talked of setting up a stone in
the grave-yard, and I thought my life was done; for I
pined sadly, and felt as if I could never laugh again.
But I did; for the Lord was very good to us, and out
of danger and captivity delivered that dear boy."</p>

<p>Grandma spoke solemnly, and folded her hands in
thanksgiving as she looked up at the picture of the
handsome officer hanging on the wall before her. The
elder children could just remember grandpa as a very
old and feeble man, and it struck them as funny to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
speak of him as a "dear boy;" but they never smiled,
and dutifully lifted their eyes to the queue and the
high-collared coat, wondering if Joe was as rosy in real
life as in the portrait.</p>

<p>"Well, that's the sentimental part; now comes the
merry part, and that will suit the boys," said the old
lady, briskly, as she spun away,&mdash;and went on in a
lively tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>"One December day, as I sat by that very window,
dreaming sorrowfully at my sewing work, while old
Sally nodded over her knitting by the fire, I saw a
man come creeping along by the fence and dodge behind
the wood-pile. There were many bad folks
'round in those times; for war always leaves a sight of
lazy rascals afloat, as well as poor fellows maimed and
homeless.</p>

<p>"Mother had gone over to the sewing society at Mrs.
Shirley's, and I was all alone; for Sally was so stiff
with rheumatics she could scarce stir, and that was
why I stayed to take care of her. The old musket
always hung over the kitchen chimney-piece, loaded,
and I knew how to fire it, for Joe had taught me. So
away I went and got it down; for I saw the man popping
up his head now and then to spy the land, and I
felt sure he meant mischief. I knew Sally would only
scream like a scared hen, so I let her sleep; and getting
behind the shutter I pointed my gun, and waited
to blaze away as soon as the enemy showed signs of
attacking.</p>

<p>"Presently he came creeping up to the back door,
and I heard him try the latch. All was fast, so I just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
slipped into the kitchen and stood behind the settle,
for I was surer than ever he was a rascal since I'd seen
him nearer. He was a tall man, dreadful shabby in an
old coat and boots, a ragged hat over his eyes, and a
great beard hiding the lower part of his face. He had
a little bundle and a big stick in his hands, and
limped as if foot-sore or lame.</p>

<p>"I was much afeard; but those were times that made
heroes of men, and taught women to be brave for love
of home and country. So I kept steady, with my eye
on the window, and my finger on the trigger of the old
gun, that hadn't been fired for years. Presently the
man looked in, and I saw what a strange roll his great
eyes had, for he was thin-faced and looked half-starved.
If mother had been there, she'd have called him in
and fed him well, but I dared not, and when he tried
the window I aimed, but did not fire; for finding the
button down he went away, and I dropped on the
settle, shaking like a leaf. All was still, and in a
minute I plucked up courage to go to look out a bit;
but just as I reached the middle of the kitchen, the
buttery door opened, and there stood the robber, with
a carving knife in one hand and my best loaf of spice
bread in the other. He said something, and made a
rush at me; but I pulled the trigger, saw a flash, felt
a blow, and fell somewhere, thinking, 'Now I'm
dead!'"</p>

<p>Here grandma paused for breath, having spoken
rapidly and acted out the scene dramatically, to the
intense delight of the children, who sat like images of
interest, staring at her with round eyes.</p>

<p>"But you weren't dead? What next?" cried Walt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Bless you, no! I only fell into Joe's arms, and
when I came to, there the dear fellow was, crying over
me like a baby, while old Sally danced round us like
a bedlamite, in spite of her rheumatics, shouting:
'Hosanna! Thanks and praise! He's come, he's
come!'"</p>

<p>"Was he shot?" asked Geoff, anxious for a little
bloodshed.</p>

<p>"No, dear; the old gun burst and hurt my hands,
but not a mite of harm was done to Joe. I don't
think I could tell all that happened for a spell, being
quite dazed with joy and surprise; but by the time
mother came home I was as peart as a wren, and Joe
was at the table eating and drinking every mortal
thing I could find in the house.</p>

<p>"He'd been kept a prisoner till exchanged, and had
had a hard time getting home, with little money and
a bad wound in the leg, besides being feeble with jail
fever. But we didn't fret over past troubles, being so
glad to get him back. How my blessed mother did
laugh, when we told her the reception I gave the poor
lad! But I said it served him right, since he came
sneaking home like a thief, instead of marching in like
a hero. Then he owned that he came there to get
something to eat, being ashamed to go in upon his
mother with all her company about her. So we fed
and comforted him; and when we'd got our wits
about us, I whipped away to Mrs. Shirley's and told
my news, and every one of those twenty-five women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
went straight over to our house and burst in upon poor
Joe, as he lay resting on the settle. That was my
revenge for the scare he gave me, and a fine one it was;
for the women chattered over him like a flock of magpies,
and I sat in the corner and laughed at him. Ah,
I was a sad puss in those days!"</p>

<p>The old lady's black eyes twinkled with fun, and the
children laughed with her, till Walt caused a lull by
asking:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where do the wolves come in, grandma?"</p>

<p>"Right along, dear; I'm not likely to forget 'em,
for they 'most cost me my life, to say nothing of my
new slippers. There was great rejoicing over Joe, and
every one wanted to do something to honor our hero;
for he had done well, we found out, when the General
heard his story. We had a great dinner, and Judge
Mullikin gave a supper; but Major Belknap was bound
to outshine the rest, so he invited all the young folks
over to his house, nigh ten miles away, to a ball, and
we all went. I made myself fine, you may believe,
and wore a pair of blue kid slippers, with mother's
best buckles to set 'em off. Joe had a new uniform,
and was an elegant figure of a man, I do assure you.
He couldn't dance, poor dear, being still very lame:
but I was a proud girl when I marched into that ball-room,
on the arm of my limping beau. The men
cheered, and the ladies stood up in chairs to see
him, and he was as red as my ribbons, and I could
hardly keep from crying, as I held him up,&mdash;the
floor being slippery as glass with the extra waxing it
had got.</p>

<p>"I declared I wouldn't dance, because Joe couldn't;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
but he made me, saying he could see me better; so I
footed it till two o'clock, soon forgetting all my sorrow
and my good resolutions as well. I wanted to show
Joe that I was as much a favorite as ever, though
I'd lived like a widow for a year. Young folks will
be giddy, and I hope these girls will take warning by
me and behave better when their time comes. There
mayn't be any wolves to sober 'em, but trouble of some
sort always follows foolish actions; so be careful, my
dears, and behave with propriety when you 'come out,'
as you call it nowadays."</p>

<p>Grandma held up a warning forefinger at the girls,
and shook her head impressively, feeling that the moral
of her tale must be made clear before she went on.
But the lassies blushed a little, and the lads looked all
impatience, so the dear old lady introduced the wolves
as quickly as she could.</p>

<p>"About half-past two, Joe and I drove off home
with four fine hams in the bottom of the sleigh, sent
by the Major to our mothers. It was a bitter-cold
February night, with just light enough to see the road,
and splendid sleighing; so we went along at a good
pace, till we came to the great woods. They are all
gone now, and the woollen mills stand there, but then
they were a thick forest of pines, and for more than
three miles the road led through them. In former
days Indians had lurked there; bears and foxes were
still shot, and occasionally wolves were seen, when cold
weather drove them to seek food near the sheep-folds
and barn-yards.</p>

<p>"Well, we were skimming along pleasantly enough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
I rather sleepy, and Joe very careful of me, when,
just as I was beginning to doze a bit with my head on
his arm I felt him start. Old Buck, the horse, gave a
jump that woke me up, and in a minute I knew what the
trouble was, for from behind us came the howl of a wolf.</p>

<p>"'Just the night to bring 'em out,' muttered Joe,
using the whip till Buck went at his quickest trot,
with his ears down and every sign of hurry and worry
about him.</p>

<p>"'Are you afraid of them?' I asked, for I'd never
had a scare of this sort, though I'd heard other people
tell of the fierceness of the brutes when hunger made
them bold.</p>

<p>"'Not a bit, only I wish I had my gun along,' said
Joe, looking over his shoulder anxiously.</p>

<p>"'Pity I hadn't brought mine&mdash;I do so well with
it,' I said, and I laughed as I remembered how I aimed
at Joe and hurt myself.</p>

<p>"'Are they chasing us?' I asked, standing up to
look back along the white road, for we were just on
the edge of the woods now.</p>

<p>"'Shouldn't wonder. If I had a better horse it
would be a lively race; but Buck can't keep this pace
long, and if he founders we are in a fix, for I can't run,
and you can't fight. Betsey, there's more than one;
hold tight and try to count 'em.'</p>

<p>"Something in Joe's voice told me plainer than
words that we were in danger, and I wished we'd
waited till the rest of our party came; but I was tired,
and so we had started alone.</p>

<p>"Straining my eyes, I could see <i>three</i> black spots on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the snow, and hear three howls as the wolves came
galloping after us. I was a brave girl, but I'd never
tried this kind of thing before, and in a minute all the
wolf stories I'd ever heard came flying through my
mind. I <i>was</i> mortally afeard, but I wouldn't show
it, and turned to Joe, trying to laugh as I said: 'Only
three as yet. Tell me just what to do, and I'll do it.'</p>

<p>"'Brave lass! I must see to Buck or he'll be down,
for he's badly scared. You wait till the rascals are
pretty close, then heave over one of these confounded
hams to amuse 'em, while we make the most of their
halt. They smell this meat, and that's what they are
after,' said Joe, driving his best, for the poor old horse
began to pant, and limp on his stiff legs.</p>

<p>"'Lucky for us we've got 'em,' says I, bound to be
cool and gay; 'if we hadn't, they'd get fresh meat
instead of smoked.'</p>

<p>"Joe laughed, but a long howl close by made me
dive for a ham; for in the darkness of the woods the
beasts had got closer, and now all I could see were
several balls of fire not many yards away. Out went
the ham, and a snarling sound showed that the wolves
were busy eating it.</p>

<p>"'All right!' said Joe. 'Rest a bit, and have
another ready. They'll soon finish that and want
more. We must go easy, for Buck is nearly blown.'</p>

<p>"I prepared my ammunition, and, in what seemed
five minutes, I heard the patter of feet behind us, and
the fiery eyes were close by. Over went the second
mouthful, and then the third, and the fourth; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
they seemed more ravenous than ever, and each time
were back sooner in greater numbers.</p>

<p>"We were nearly out of the woods when the last
was gone, and if Buck had only had strength we should
have been safe. But it was plain to see that he couldn't
keep up much longer, for he was very old, though he'd
been a fine horse in his prime.</p>

<p>"'This looks bad, little Betsey. Cover up in the
robes, and hold fast to me. The beasts will begin to
snatch presently, and I'll have to fight 'em off. Thank
the powers, I've my arms left.'</p>

<p>"As he spoke, Joe pulled me close, and wrapped
me up, then took the whip, ready to rap the first wolf
that dared come near enough to be hit. We didn't
wait long; up they raced, and began to leap and snarl
in a way that made my heart stand still, at first. Then
my temper rose, and catching up the hot brick I had
for my feet, I fired it with such good aim that one
sharp, black nose disappeared with a yelp of pain.</p>

<p>"'Hit 'em again, Betsey! Take the demijohn and
bang 'em well. We are nearing Beaman's, and the
brutes will soon drop off.'</p>

<p>"It was a lively scrimmage for a few minutes, as we
both warmed to our work, Joe thrashing away with
his whip on one side, and I on the other flourishing
the demijohn in which we had carried some cider for
the supper.</p>

<p>"But it was soon over, for in the fury of the fight
Joe forgot the horse; poor Buck made a sudden bolt,
upset the sleigh down a bank, and, breaking loose, tore
back along the road with the wolves after him.</p>

<p>"'Run, Betsey! run for your life, and send Beaman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
folks back! I'm done for&mdash;my leg's broken. Never
mind. I'll crawl under the sleigh, and be all right
till you come. The wolves will take a good while to
pick poor Buck's bones.'</p>

<p>"Just waiting to see Joe safe, I ran as I never ran
before,&mdash;and I was always light of foot. How I did it
I don't know, for I'd forgot to put on my moccasins
(we didn't have snow-boots, you know, in my young
days), and there I was, tearing along that snowy road
in my blue kid slippers like a crazy thing. It was nigh
a mile, and my heart was 'most broke before I got there;
but I kept my eye on the light in Hetty's winder and
tugged along, blessing her for the guide and comfort
that candle was. The last bit was down hill, or I
couldn't have done it; for when I fell on the doorstep
my voice was clean gone, and I could only lie and
rap, rap, rap! till they came flying. I just got breath
enough to gasp out and point:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Joe&mdash;wolves&mdash;the big woods&mdash;go!' when my
senses failed me, and I was carried in."</p>

<p>Here Madam Shirley leaned back in her chair quite
used up, for she had been acting the scene to a breathless
audience, and laying about her with her handkerchief
so vigorously that her eyes snapped, her cheeks
were red, and her dear old cap all awry.</p>

<p>"But Joe&mdash;did they eat him?" cried the boys in
great excitement, while the girls held to one another,
and the poor little wheel lay flat, upset by the blows of
the imaginary demijohn, dealt to an equally imaginary
wolf.</p>

<p>"Hardly,&mdash;since he lived to be your grandfather,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
laughed the old lady, in high feather at the success of
her story.</p>

<p>"No, no,&mdash;we mean the horse;" shouted Geoff,
while the others roared at the mistake.</p>

<p>"Yes, they did. Poor old Buck saved us, at the
cost of his own life. His troubles were over, but mine
were not; for when I came to, I saw Mr. Beaman, and
my first thought and word was 'Joe?'"</p>

<p>"'Too late&mdash;they'd got him, so we turned back to
tell you,' said that stupid man.</p>

<p>"I gave one cry and was going off again, when his
wife shook me, and says, laughing: 'You little goose!
He means the folks from the Major's. A lot came
along and found Joe, and took him home, and soon's
ever you're fit we'll send you along, too.'</p>

<p>"'I'm ready now,' says I, jumping up in a hurry.
But I had to sit down again, for my feet were all cut
and bleeding, and my slippers just rags. They fixed
me up and off I went, to find mother in a sad taking.
But Joe was all right; he hadn't broken his leg, but
only sprained it badly, and being the wounded one he
was laid up longer than I. We both got well, however,
and the first time Joe went out he hobbled over to our
house. I was spinning again then, and thought I might
need my wedding outfit, after all&mdash;On the whole,
I guess we'll end the story here; young folks wouldn't
care for that part."</p>

<p>As grandma paused, the girls cried out with one
voice: "Yes, we do! we like it best. You said you
would. Tell about the wedding and all."</p>

<p>"Well, well, it isn't much. Joe came and sat by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
me, and, as we talked over our adventure, he cut that
true lover's knot between the letters. I didn't seem
to mind, and spun away till he pointed to it, saying,
with the look that always made me meek as a lamb,
'May it stand so, my little Betsey?'</p>

<p>"I said 'Yes, Joe,' and then&mdash;well, never mind that
bit;&mdash;we were married in June, and I spun and wove
my wedding things afterward. Dreadful slack, my
mother thought, but I didn't care. My wedding gown
was white lutestring, full trimmed with old lace. Hair
over a cushion with white roses, and the pearl necklace,
just as you see up there. Joe wore his uniform, and
I tied up his hair with a white satin ribbon. He looked
beautiful,&mdash;and so did I."</p>

<p>At this artless bit of vanity, the girls smiled, but all
agreed that grandma was right, as they looked at the
portraits with fresh interest.</p>

<p>"I call that a pretty good story," said Walt, with the
air of an accomplished critic.</p>

<p>"'Specially the wolf part. I wanted that longer,"
added Geoff.</p>

<p>"It was quite long enough for me, my dear, and I
didn't hear the last of it for years. Why, one of my
wedding presents was four hams done up elegantly in
white paper, with posies on 'em, from the Major. He
loved a joke, and never forgot how well we fought with
the pigs' legs that night. Joe gave me a new sleigh,
the next Christmas, with two wolf-skin robes for it,&mdash;shot
the beasts himself, and I kept those rugs till the
moths ate the last bit.   He kept the leavings of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
slippers, and I have them still. Fetch 'em, Minnie&mdash;you
know where they are."</p>

<p>Grandma pointed to the tall secretary that stood in a
corner, and Minnie quickly took a box from one of the
many drawers. All the heads clustered around grandma,
and the faded, ragged shoes went from hand to
hand, while questions rained upon the story-teller till
she bade them go to bed.</p>

<p>Nothing but the promise of more tales would appease
them; then, with thanks and kisses, the young folks
trooped away, leaving the old lady to put the little
wheel to rights, and sit thinking over her girlhood, in
the fire-light.

<p>The storm kept on all night, and next morning the
drifts were higher, the wind stronger, and the snow
falling faster than ever. Through the day the children
roved about the great house, amusing themselves as
best they could; and, when evening came, they gathered
around the fire again, eager for the promised story
from grandmamma.</p>

<p>"I've a little cold," said the old lady, "and am too
hoarse for talking, my dears; but Aunt Elinor has
looked up a parcel of old tales that I've told her at
different times and which she has written down. You
will like to hear her reading better than my dull way
of telling them, and I can help Minnie and Lotty with
their work, for I see they are bent on learning to
spin."</p>

<p>The young folk were well pleased with grandma's
proposal; for Aunt Nell was a favorite with all, being
lively and kind and fond of children, and the only
maiden aunt in the family. Now, she smilingly produced
a faded old portfolio, and, turning over a little
pile of manuscripts, said in her pleasant way:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here are all sorts, picked up in my travels at home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and abroad; and in order to suit all of you, I have put
the names on slips of paper into this basket, and each
can draw one in turn. Does that please my distinguished
audience?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Geoff's the oldest, let him draw first,"
cried the flock, fluttering like a flight of birds before
they settle.</p>

<p>"Girls come first," answered the boy, with a nod
toward the eldest girl cousin.</p>

<p>Lotty put in her hand and, after some fumbling, drew
out a paper on which was written, "<i>Tabby's Table-cloth</i>."
"Is that a good one?" she asked, for Geoff looked disappointed.</p>

<p>"More fighting, though a girl is still the heroine,"
answered Aunt Nell, searching for the manuscript.</p>

<p>"I think two revolutions will be enough for you,
General," added grandmamma, laughing.</p>

<p>"Do we beat in both?" asked the boy, brightening
up at once.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All right, then. I vote for 'Dolly's Dish-cloth,' or
whatever it is; though I don't see what it can possibly
have to do with war," he added.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear, women have their part to play as
well as men at such times, and do it bravely, though
one does not hear so much about their courage. I've
often wished some one would collect all that can be
found about these neglected heroines, and put it in a
book for us to read, admire, and emulate when our
turn comes."</p>

<p>Grandma looked thoughtfully at the fire as she spoke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and Lotty said, with her eye on the portfolio: "Perhaps
Aunt Nell will do it for us. Then history won't be
so dry, and we can glorify our fore-mothers as well as
fathers."</p>

<p>"I'll see what I can find. Now spin away, Minnie,
and sit still, boys,&mdash;if you can."</p>

<p>Then, having settled grandma's foot-stool, and turned
up the lamp, Aunt Nell read the tale of</p>


<h4>TABBY'S TABLE-CLOTH.</h4>

<p>On the 20th day of March, 1775, a little girl was
trudging along a country road, with a basket of eggs on
her arm. She seemed in a great hurry, and looked
anxiously about her as she went; for those were stirring
times, and Tabitha Tarbell lived in a town that
took a famous part in the Revolution. She was a rosy-faced,
bright-eyed lass of fourteen, full of vigor, courage,
and patriotism, and just then much excited by the frequent
rumors which reached Concord that the British
were coming to destroy the stores sent there for safe
keeping while the enemy occupied Boston. Tabby
glowed with wrath at the idea, and (metaphorically
speaking) shook her fist at august King George, being a
stanch little Rebel, ready to fight and die for her country
rather than submit to tyranny of any kind.</p>

<p>In nearly every house something valuable was hidden.
Colonel Barrett had six barrels of powder; Ebenezer
Hubbard, sixty-eight barrels of flour; axes, tents,
and spades were at Daniel Cray's; and Captain David<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Brown had guns, cartridges, and musket balls. Cannon
were hidden in the woods; fire-arms were being
manufactured at Barrett's Mills; cartouch-boxes, belts,
and holsters, at Reuben Brown's; saltpetre at Josiah
Melvin's; and much oatmeal was prepared at Captain
Timothy Wheeler's. A morning gun was fired, a guard
of ten men patrolled the town at night, and the brave
farmers were making ready for what they felt must come.</p>

<p>There were Tories in the town who gave the enemy
all the information they could gather; therefore much
caution was necessary in making plans, lest these enemies
should betray them. Pass-words were adopted,
secret signals used, and messages sent from house to
house in all sorts of queer ways. Such a message lay
hidden under the eggs in Tabby's basket, and the brave
little girl was going on an important errand from her
uncle, Captain David Brown, to Deacon Cyrus Hosmer,
who lived at the other end of the town, by the South
Bridge. She had been employed several times before
in the same way, and had proved herself quick-witted,
stout-hearted, and light-footed. Now, as she trotted
along in her scarlet cloak and hood, she was wishing
she could still further distinguish herself by some great
act of heroism; for good Parson Emerson had patted her
on the head and said, "Well done, child!" when he
heard how she ran all the way to Captain Barrett's, in
the night, to warn him that Doctor Lee, the Tory, had
been detected sending information of certain secret
plans to the enemy.</p>

<p>"I would do more than that, though it was a fearsome
run through the dark woods. Wouldn't those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
two like to know all I know about the stores? But I
wouldn't tell 'em, not if they drove a bayonet through
me. I'm not afeard of 'em;" and Tabby tossed her
head defiantly, as she paused to shift her basket from
one arm to the other.</p>

<p>But she evidently was "afeard" of something, for
her ruddy cheeks turned pale and her heart gave a
thump, as two men came in sight, and stopped suddenly
on seeing her. They were strangers; and though nothing
in their dress indicated it, the girl's quick eye saw
that they were soldiers; step and carriage betrayed it,
and the rapidity with which these martial gentlemen
changed into quiet travellers roused her suspicions at
once. They exchanged a few whispered words; then
they came on, swinging their stout sticks, one whistling,
the other keeping a keen lookout along the lonely
road before and behind them.</p>

<p>"My pretty lass, can you tell me where Mr. Daniel
Bliss lives?" asked the younger, with a smile and a
salute.</p>

<p>Tabby was sure now that they were British; for the
voice was deep and full, the face a ruddy English face,
and the man they wanted was a well-known Tory.
But she showed no sign of alarm, beyond the modest
color in her cheeks, and answered civilly: "Yes, sir,
over yonder a piece."</p>

<p>"Thanks, and a kiss for that," said the young man,
stooping to bestow his gift. But he got a smart box on
the ear, and Tabby ran off in a fury of indignation.</p>

<p>With a laugh they went on, never dreaming that the
little Rebel was going to turn spy herself, and get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
better of them. She hurried away to Deacon Hosmer's,
and did her errand, adding thereto the news that
strangers were in town. "We must know more of
them," said the Deacon. "Clap a different suit on
her, wife, and send her with the eggs to Mrs. Bliss.
We have all we want of them, and Tabby can look well
about her, while she rests and gossips over there. Bliss
must be looked after smartly, for he is a knave, and will
do us harm."</p>

<p>Away went Tabby in a blue cloak and hood, much
pleased with her mission; and, coming to the Tory's
house about noon, smelt afar off a savory odor of roasting
meat and baking pies.</p>

<p>Stepping softly to the back-door, she peeped through
a small window, and saw Mrs. Bliss and her handmaid
cooking away in the big kitchen, too busy to heed the
little spy, who slipped around to the front of the house,
to take a general survey before she went in. All she
saw confirmed her suspicions; for in the keeping-room
a table was set forth in great style, with the silver tankards,
best china, and the fine damask table-cloth, which
the housewife kept for holidays. Still another peep
through the lilac bushes before the parlor windows
showed her the two strangers closeted with Mr. Bliss,
all talking earnestly, but in too low a tone for a word
to reach even her sharp ears.</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> know what they are at. I'm sure it is mischief,
and I won't go back with only my walk for my
pains," thought Tabby; and marching into the kitchen,
she presented her eggs with a civil message from Madam
Hosmer.</p>

<p>"They are mighty welcome, child. I've used a sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
for my custards, and need more for the flip. We've
company to dinner unexpected, and I'm much put
about," said Mrs. Bliss, who seemed to be concerned
about something besides the dinner, and in her flurry
forgot to be surprised at the unusual gift; for the neighbors
shunned them, and the poor woman had many
anxieties on her husband's account, the family being
divided,&mdash;one brother a Tory, and one a Rebel.</p>

<p>"Can I help, ma'am? I'm a master hand at beating
eggs, Aunt Hitty says. I'm tired, and wouldn't mind
sitting a bit if I'm not in the way," said Tabby, bound
to discover something more before she left.</p>

<p>"But you be in the way. We don't want any help,
so you'd better be steppin' along home, else suthin' besides
eggs may git whipped. Tale-bearers ain't welcome
here," said old Puah, the maid, a sour spinster,
who sympathized with her master, and openly declared
she hoped the British would put down the Yankee
Rebels soon and sharply.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bliss was in the pantry, and heard nothing of
this little passage of arms; for Tabby hotly resented
the epithet of "tale-bearer," though she knew that the
men in the parlor were not the only spies on the
premises.</p>

<p>"When you are all drummed out of town and this
house burnt to the ground, you may be glad of my help,
and I wish you may get it. Good-day, old crab-apple,"
answered saucy Tabby; and catching up her basket,
she marched out of the kitchen with her nose in the
air.</p>

<p>But as she passed the front of the house, she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
not resist another look at the fine dinner-table; for in
those days few had time or heart for feasting, and the
best napery and china seldom appeared. One window
stood open, and as the girl leaned in, something moved
under the long cloth that swept the floor. It was not
the wind, for the March day was still and sunny, and
in a minute out popped a gray cat's head, and puss came
purring to meet the new-comer whose step had roused
her from a nap.</p>

<p>"Where one tabby hides, another can. Can I dare
to do it? What would become of me if found out?
How wonderful it would be if I could hear what these
men are plotting. I will!"</p>

<p>A sound in the next room decided her; and, thrusting
the basket among the bushes, she leaped lightly in
and vanished under the table, leaving puss calmly
washing her face on the window-sill.</p>

<p>As soon as it was done Tabby's heart began to flutter;
but it was too late to retreat, for at that moment in
bustled Mrs. Bliss, and the poor girl could only make
herself as small as possible, quite hidden under the long
folds that fell on all sides from the wide, old-fashioned
table. She discovered nothing from the women's chat,
for it ran on sage-cheese, egg-nog, roast pork, and lamentations
over a burnt pie. By the time dinner was
served, and the guests called in to eat it, Tabby was
calm enough to have all her wits about her, and pride
gave her courage to be ready for the consequences,
whatever they might be.</p>

<p>For a time the hungry gentlemen were too busy eating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to talk much; but when Mrs. Bliss went out, and
the flip came in, they were ready for business. The
window was shut, whereat Tabby exulted that she was
inside; the talkers drew closer together, and spoke so
low that she could only catch a sentence now and then,
which caused her to pull her hair with vexation; and
they swore a good deal, to the great horror of the pious
little maiden curled up at their feet. But she heard
enough to prove that she was right; for these men were
Captain Brown and Ensign De Bernicre, of the British
army, come to learn where the supplies were stored and
how well the town was defended. She heard Mr. Bliss
tell them that some of the "Rebels," as he called his
neighbors, had sent him word that he should not leave
the town alive, and he was in much fear for his life and
property. She heard the Englishmen tell him that if
he came with them they would protect him; for they
were armed, and three of them together could surely
get safely off, as no one knew the strangers had arrived
but the slip of a girl who showed them the way. Here
"the slip of a girl" nodded her head savagely, and hoped
the speaker's ear still tingled with the buffet she gave it.</p>

<p>Mr. Bliss gladly consented to this plan, and told them
he would show them the road to Lexington, which was
a shorter way to Boston than through Weston and Sudbury,
the road they came.</p>

<p>"These people won't fight, will they?" asked Ensign
De Bernicre.</p>

<p>"There goes a man who will fight you to the death,"
answered Mr. Bliss, pointing to his brother Tom, busy
in a distant field.</p>

<p>The Ensign swore again, and gave a stamp that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
brought his heavy heel down on poor Tabby's hand, as
she leaned forward to catch every word. The cruel
blow nearly forced a cry from her; but she bit her lips
and never stirred, though faint with pain. When she
could listen again, Mr. Bliss was telling all he knew
about the hiding places of the powder, grain, and cannon
the enemy wished to capture and destroy. He
could not tell much, for the secrets had been well kept;
but if he had known that our young Rebel was taking
notes of his words under his own table, he might have
been less ready to betray his neighbors. No one suspected
a listener, however, and all Tabby could do was
to scowl at three pairs of muddy boots, and wish she
were a man that she might fight the wearers of
them.</p>

<p>She very nearly had a chance to fight or fly; for
just as they were preparing to leave the table, a sudden
sneeze nearly undid her. She thought she was lost,
and hid her face, expecting to be dragged out&mdash;to instant
death, perhaps&mdash;by the wrathful men of war.</p>

<p>"What's that?" exclaimed the Ensign, as a sudden
pause followed that fatal sound.</p>

<p>"It came from under the table," added Captain
Brown, and a hand lifted a corner of the cloth.</p>

<p>A shiver went through Tabby, and she held her
breath, with her eye upon that big, brown hand; but
the next moment she could have laughed with joy, for
pussy saved her. The cat had come to doze on her
warm skirts, and when the cloth was raised, fancying
she was to be fed by her master, puss rose and walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
out purring loudly, tail erect, with its white tip waving
like a flag of truce.</p>

<p>"'Tis but the old cat, gentlemen. A good beast, and,
fortunately for us, unable to report our conference," said
Mr. Bliss, with an air of relief, for he had started guiltily
at the bare idea of an eavesdropper.</p>

<p>"She sneezed as if she were as great a snuff-taker as
an old woman of whom we asked our way above here,"
laughed the Ensign, as they all rose.</p>

<p>"And there she is now, coming along as if our grenadiers
were after her!" exclaimed the Captain, as the
sound of steps and a wailing voice came nearer and
nearer.</p>

<p>Tabby took a long breath, and vowed that she would
beg or buy the dear old cat that had saved her from
destruction. Then she forgot her own danger in listening
to the poor woman, who came in crying that her
neighbors said she must leave town at once, or they
would tar and feather her for showing spies the road
to a Tory's house.</p>

<p>"Well for me I came and heard their plots, or I
might be sent off in like case," thought the girl, feeling
that the more perils she encountered, the greater heroine
she would be.</p>

<p>Mr. Bliss comforted the old soul, bidding her stay
there till the neighbors forgot her, and the officers gave
her some money to pay for the costly service she had
done them. Then they left the room, and after some
delay the three men set off; but Tabby was compelled
to stay in her hiding-place till the table was cleared, and
the women deep in gossip, as they washed dishes in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
kitchen. Then the little spy crept out softly, and raising
the window with great care, ran away as fast as her
stiff limbs would carry her.</p>

<p>By the time she reached the Deacon's, however, and
told her tale, the Tories were well on their way, Mr.
Bliss having provided them with horses that his own
flight might be the speedier.</p>

<p>So they escaped; but the warning was given, and
Tabby received great praise for her hour under the
table. The town's-people hastened their preparations,
and had time to remove the most valuable stores to
neighboring towns; to mount their cannon and drill
their minute-men; for these resolute farmers meant to
resist oppression, and the world knows how well they
did it when the hour came.</p>

<p>Such an early spring had not been known for years;
and by the 19th of April fruit trees were in bloom, winter
grain was up, and the stately elms that fringed the
river and overarched the village streets were budding
fast. It seemed a pity that such a lovely world should
be disturbed by strife; but liberty was dearer than
prosperity or peace, and the people leaped from their
beds when young Dr. Prescott came, riding for his life,
with the message Paul Revere brought from Boston in
the night:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arm! arm! the British are coming!"</p>

<p>Like an electric spark the news ran from house to
house, and men made ready to fight, while the brave
women bade them go, and did their best to guard the
treasure confided to their keeping. A little later, word
came that the British were at Lexington, and blood had
been shed. Then the farmers shouldered their guns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
with few words but stern faces, and by sunrise a hundred
men stood ready, with good Parson Emerson at
their head. More men were coming in from the neighboring
towns, and all felt that the hour had arrived
when patience ceased to be a virtue and rebellion was
just.</p>

<p>Great was the excitement everywhere; but at Captain
David Brown's one little heart beat high with hope and
fear, as Tabby stood at the door, looking across the river
to the town, where drums were beating, bells ringing, and
people hurrying to and fro.</p>

<p>"I can't fight, but I <i>must</i> see," she said; and catching
up her cloak, she ran over the North Bridge, promising
her aunt to return and bring her word as soon as the
enemy appeared.</p>

<p>"What news? Are they coming?" called the people,
from the Manse and the few houses that then stood
along that road. But Tabby could only shake her head
and run the faster, in her eagerness to see what was happening
on that memorable day. When she reached the
middle of the town she found that the little company
had gone along the Lexington road to meet the enemy.
Nothing daunted, she hurried in that direction and,
climbing a high bank, waited to catch a glimpse of the
British grenadiers, of whom she had heard so much.</p>

<p>About seven o'clock they came, the sun glittering on
the arms of eight hundred English soldiers marching
toward the hundred stout-hearted farmers, who waited
till they were within a few rods of them.</p>

<p>"Let us stand our ground; and if we die, let us die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
here," said brave Parson Emerson, still among his people,
ready for anything but surrender.</p>

<p>"Nay," said a cautious Lincoln man, "it will not do
for us to <i>begin</i> the war."</p>

<p>So they reluctantly fell back to the town, the British
following slowly, being weary with their seven-mile
march over the hills from Lexington. Coming to a little
brown house perched on the hillside, one of the
thirsty officers spied a well, with the bucket swinging
at the end of the long pole. Running up the bank, he
was about to drink, when a girl, who was crouching behind
the well, sprang up, and with an energetic gesture,
flung the water in his face, crying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's the way we serve spies!"</p>

<p>Before Ensign De Bernicre&mdash;for it was he, acting as
guide to the enemy&mdash;could clear his eyes and dry his
drenched face, Tabby was gone over the hill with a
laugh and a defiant gesture toward the red-coats below.</p>

<p>In high feather at this exploit, she darted about the
town, watching the British at their work of destruction.
They cut down and burnt the liberty pole, broke open
sixty barrels of flour, flung five hundred pounds of balls
into the mill-pond and wells, and set the court-house on
fire. Other parties were ordered to different quarters of
the town to ransack houses and destroy all the stores
they found. Captain Parsons was sent to take possession
of the North Bridge, and De Bernicre led the way,
for he had taken notes on his former visit, and was a
good guide. As they marched, a little scarlet figure
went flying on before them, and vanished at the turn of
the road. It was Tabby hastening home to warn her aunt.</p>

<p>"Quick child, whip on this gown and cap and hurry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
into bed. These prying fellows will surely have pity
on a sick girl, and respect this room if no other," said
Mrs. Brown, briskly helping Tabby into a short night-gown
and round cap, and tucking her well up when she
was laid down, for between the plump feather-beds were
hidden many muskets, the most precious of their stores.
This had been planned beforehand, and Tabby was glad
to rest and tell her tale while Aunty Brown put physic
bottles and glasses on the table, set some evil-smelling
herbs to simmer on the hearth, and, compromising with
her conscience, concocted a nice little story to tell the
invaders.</p>

<p>Presently they came, and it was well for Tabby that
the ensign remained below to guard the doors while the
men ransacked the house from garret to cellar; for he
might have recognized the saucy girl who had twice
maltreated him.</p>

<p>"These are feathers; lift the covers carefully or
you'll be half smothered, they fly about so," said Mrs.
Brown, as the men came to some casks of cartridges
and flints, which she had artfully ripped up several
pillows to conceal.</p>

<p>Quite deceived, the men gladly passed on, leaving the
very things they most wanted to destroy. Coming to
the bed-room, where more treasures of the same valuable
sort were hidden in various nooks and corners, the
dame held up her finger, saying, with an anxious glance
toward Tabby:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Step softly, please. You wouldn't harm a poor,
sick girl. The doctor thinks it is small-pox, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
fright might kill her. I keep the chamber as fresh as
I can with yarbs, so I guess there isn't much danger
of catching it."</p>

<p>The men reluctantly looked in, saw a flushed face on
the pillow (for Tabby was red with running, and her
black eyes wild with excitement), took a sniff at the
wormwood and motherwort, and with a hasty glance into
a closet or two where sundry clothes concealed hidden
doors, hastily retired to report the danger and get
away as soon as possible.</p>

<p>They would have been much disgusted at the trick
played upon them if they had seen the sick girl fly out
of bed and dance a jig of joy as they tramped away to
Barrett's Mills. But soon Tabby had no heart for merriment,
as she watched the minute-men gather by the
bridge, saw the British march down on the other side,
and when their first volley killed brave Isaac Davis
and Abner Hosmer, of Acton, she heard Major Buttrick
give the order, "Fire, fellow-soldiers; for God's sake,
fire!"</p>

<p>For a little while shots rang, smoke rose, shouts were
heard, and red and blue coats mingled in the struggle
on the bridge. Then the British fell back, leaving two
dead soldiers behind them. These were buried where
they fell; and the bodies of the Acton men were sent
home to their poor wives, Concord's first martyrs for
liberty.</p>

<p>No need to tell more of the story of that day; all
children know it, and many have made a pilgrimage to
see the old monument set up where the English fell,
and the bronze Minute-Man, standing on his granite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
pedestal to mark the spot where the brave Concord
farmers fired the shot that made the old North Bridge
immortal.</p>

<p>We must follow Tabby, and tell how she got her table-cloth.
When the fight was over, the dead buried, the
wounded cared for, and the prisoners exchanged, the
Tories were punished. Dr. Lee was confined to his
own farm, on penalty of being shot if he left it, and
the property of Daniel Bliss was confiscated by government.
Some things were sold at auction, and Captain
Brown bought the fine cloth and gave it to Tabby, saying
heartily:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There, my girl, that belongs to you, and you may
well be proud of it; for, thanks to your quick wits and
eyes and ears, we were not taken unawares, but sent the
red-coats back faster than they came."</p>

<p>And Tabby <i>was</i> proud of it, keeping it carefully, displaying
it with immense satisfaction whenever she told
the story, and spinning busily to make a set of napkins
to go with it. It covered the table when her wedding
supper was spread, was used at the christening of her
first boy, and for many a Thanksgiving and Christmas
dinner through the happy years of her married life.</p>

<p>Then it was preserved by her daughters, as a relic of
their mother's youth, and long after the old woman was
gone, the well-worn cloth still appeared on great occasions,
till it grew too thin for anything but careful keeping,
to illustrate the story so proudly told by the grandchildren,
who found it hard to believe that the feeble
old lady of ninety could be the lively lass who played
her little part in the Revolution with such spirit.</p>

<p>In 1861, Tabby's table-cloth saw another war, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
made an honorable end. When men were called for,
Concord responded "Here!" and sent a goodly number,
led by another brave Colonel Prescott. Barretts,
Hosmers, Melvins, Browns, and Wheelers stood shoulder
to shoulder, as their grandfathers stood that day to meet
the British by the bridge. Mothers said, "Go my son,"
as bravely as before, and sisters and sweethearts smiled
with wet eyes as the boys in blue marched away again,
cheered on by another noble Emerson. More than one
of Tabby's descendants went, some to fight, some to
nurse; and for four long years the old town worked and
waited, hoped and prayed, burying the dear dead boys
sent home, nursing those who brought back honorable
wounds, and sending more to man the breaches made
by the awful battles that filled both North and South
with a wilderness of graves.</p>

<p>The women knit and sewed Sundays as well as weekdays,
to supply the call for clothes; the men emptied
their pockets freely, glad to give; and the minister,
after preaching like a Christian soldier, took off his
coat and packed boxes of comforts like a tender father.</p>

<p>"More lint and bandages called for, and I do believe
we've torn and picked up every old rag in the town,"
said one busy lady to another, as several sat together
making comfort-bags in the third year of the long
struggle.</p>

<p>"I have cleared my garret of nearly everything in it,
and only wish I had more to give," answered one of the
patriotic Barrett mothers.</p>

<p>"We can't buy anything so soft and good as worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
out sheets and table-cloths. New ones wont do, or
I'd cut up every one of mine," said a newly married
Wheeler, sewing for dear life, as she remembered the
many cousins gone to the war.</p>

<p>"I think I shall have to give our Revolutionary
table-cloth. It's old enough, and soft as silk, and
I'm sure my blessed grandmother would think that
it couldn't make a better end," spoke up white-headed
Madam Hubbard; for Tabby Tarbell had married one
of that numerous and worthy race.</p>

<p>"Oh, you wouldn't cut up that famous cloth, would
you?" cried the younger woman.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will. It's in rags, and when I'm gone no
one will care for it. Folks don't seem to remember
what the women did in those days, so it's no use
keeping relics of 'em," answered the old lady, who
would have owned herself mistaken if she could have
looked forward to 1876, when the town celebrated its
centennial, and proudly exhibited the little scissors
with which Mrs. Barrett cut paper for cartridges,
among other ancient trophies of that earlier day.</p>

<p>So the ancient cloth was carefully made into a boxful
of the finest lint and softest squares to lay on
wounds, and sent to one of the Concord women who
had gone as a nurse.</p>

<p>"Here's a treasure!" she said, as she came to it among
other comforts newly arrived from home. "Just what
I want for my brave Rebel and poor little Johnny
Bullard."</p>

<p>The "brave Rebel" was a Southern man who had
fought well and was badly wounded in many ways,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
yet never complained; and in the midst of great
suffering was always so courteous, patient, and courageous,
that the men called him "our gentleman," and
tried to show how much they respected so gallant a
foe. John Bullard was an English drummer-boy, who
had been through several battles, stoutly drumming
away in spite of bullets and cannon-balls; cheering
many a camp-fire with his voice, for he sang like a
blackbird, and was always merry, always plucky, and
so great a favorite in his regiment, that all mourned
for "little Johnny" when his right arm was shot off
at Gettysburg. It was thought he would die; but
he pulled through the worst of it, and was slowly
struggling back to health, still trying to be gay, and
beginning to chirp feebly now and then, like a convalescent
bird.</p>

<p>"Here, Johnny, is some splendid lint for this poor
arm, and some of the softest compresses for Carrol's
wound. He is asleep, so I'll begin with you, and
while I work I'll amuse you with the story of the old
table-cloth this lint came from," said Nurse Hunt, as
she stood by the bed where the thin, white face smiled
at her, though the boy dreaded the hard quarter of an
hour he had to endure every day.</p>

<p>"Thanky, mum. We 'aven't 'ad a story for a good
bit. I'm 'arty this mornin', and think I'll be hup
by this day week, won't I?"</p>

<p>"I hope so. Now shut your eyes and listen; then
you wont mind the twinges I give you, gentle as I try
to be," answered the nurse, beginning her painful
task.</p>

<p>Then she told the story of Tabby's table-cloth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the boy enjoyed it immensely, laughing out at the
slapping and the throwing water in the ensign's face,
and openly rejoicing when the red-coats got the worst
of it.</p>

<p>"As we've beaten all the rest of the world, I don't
mind our 'aving bad luck that time. We har' friends
now, and I'll fight for you, mum, like a British bull-dog,
if I hever get the chance," said Johnny, when the
tale and dressing were ended.</p>

<p>"So you shall. I like to turn a brave enemy into
a faithful friend, as I hope we shall yet be able to do
with our Southern brothers. I admire their courage
and their loyalty to what they believe to be right;
and we are all suffering the punishment we deserve
for waiting till this sad war came, instead of settling
the trouble years ago, as we might have done if we
had loved honesty and honor more than money and
power."</p>

<p>As she spoke, Miss Hunt turned to her other patient,
and saw by the expression of his face that he had
heard both the tale and the talk. He smiled, and said,
"Good morning," as usual, but when she stooped to
lay a compress of the soft, wet damask on the angry
wound in his breast, he whispered, with a grateful
look:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You <i>have</i> changed one 'Southern brother' from an
enemy into a friend. Whether I live or die, I never
can forget how generous and kind you have all been
to me."</p>

<p>"Thank you! It is worth months of anxiety and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
care to hear such words. Let us shake hands, and do
our best to make North and South as good friends as
England and America now are," said the nurse, offering
her hand.</p>

<p>"Me, too! I've got one 'and left, and I give it ye
with all me 'art. God bless ye, sir, and a lively getting
hup for the two of us!" cried Johnny, stretching
across the narrow space that divided the beds, with a
beaming face and true English readiness to forgive
a fallen foe when he had proved a brave one.</p>

<p>The three hands met in a warm shake, and the act
was a little lesson more eloquent than words to the
lookers-on; for the spirit of brotherhood that should
bind us all together worked the miracle of linking
these three by the frail threads spun a century ago.</p>

<p>So Tabby's table-cloth did make a beautiful and
useful end at last.<br /></p>

<p>"My turn now," said Walt, as they assembled
again, after a busy day spent in snow-balling, statue-making,
and tumbling in the drifts that still continued
to rise on all sides.</p>

<p>"Here is just the story for you and Geoff. You
are getting ready for college, after years of the best
schooling, and it will do you good to hear how hard
some boys have had to work to get a little learning,"
said Grandma, glancing at the slip that Walt drew
from the basket which Aunt Elinor held out to him,
and from which Lotty had drawn the story of
"Tabby's Table Cloth."</p>

<p>"This is a true tale, and the man became famous
for his wisdom, as well as much loved and honored
for his virtue, and interest in all good things," added
Aunt Elinor, as she began to read the story of</p>

<h4>ELI'S EDUCATION.</h4>

<p>Many years ago, a boy of sixteen sat in a little
room in an old farm-house up among the Connecticut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
hills, writing busily in a book made of odd bits of
paper stitched together, with a cover formed of two
thin boards. The lid of a blue chest was his desk, the
end of a tallow candle stuck into a potato was his
lamp, a mixture of soot and vinegar his ink, and a
quill from the gray goose his pen. A "Webster's Spelling-book,"
"Dilworth's New Guide to the English
Tongue," "Daboll's Arithmetic," and the "American
Preceptor," stood on the chimney-piece over his head,
with the "Assembly Catechism," and New Testament,
in the place of honor. This was his library; and now
and then a borrowed "Pilgrim's Progress," "Fox's
Book of Martyrs," or some stray volume, gladdened his
heart; for he passionately loved books, and scoured the
neighborhood for miles around to feed this steadily increasing
hunger. Every penny he could earn or save
went to buy a song or a story from the peddlers who
occasionally climbed the hill to the solitary farm-house.
When others took a noon-spell, he read under the trees
or by the fire. He carried a book in his pocket, and
studied as he went with the cows to and from the pasture,
and sat late in his little room, ciphering on an old
slate, or puzzling his young brain over some question
which no one could answer for him.</p>

<p>His father had no patience with him, called him a
shiftless dreamer, and threatened to burn the beloved
books. But his mother defended him, for he was her
youngest and the pride of her heart; so she let him
scribble all over her floors before she scrubbed them
up, dipped extra thick candles for his use, saved every
scrap of paper to swell his little store, and firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
believed that he would turn out the great man of the
family. His brothers joked about his queer ways, but
in his sisters he found firm friends and tender comforters
for all his woes. So he struggled along,
working on the farm in summer and in a clock shop
during the winter, with such brief spells of schooling
as he could get between whiles, improving even these
poor opportunities so well that he was letter-writer for
all the young people in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Now, he was writing in his journal very slowly, but
very well, shaping his letters with unusual grace and
freedom; for the wide snow-banks were his copy-books
in winter, and on their white pages he had learned to
sweep splendid capitals or link syllables handsomely
together. This is what he wrote that night, with a
sparkle in the blue eyes and a firm folding of the lips
that made the boyish face resolute and manly.</p>

<blockquote><p>"I am set in my own mind that I get learning. I see not
how, but my will is strong, and mother hopes for to make a
scholar of me. So, please God, we shall do it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Then he shut the little book and put it carefully
away in the blue chest, with pen and ink, as if they
were very precious things; piously said his prayers,
and was soon asleep under the homespun coverlet,
dreaming splendid dreams, while a great bright star
looked in at the low window, as if waiting to show
him the road to fortune.</p>

<p>And God did please to help the patient lad; only
the next evening came an opportunity he had never
imagined. As he sat playing "Over the Hills and Far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Away" on the fiddle that he had himself made out of
maple-wood, with a bow strung from the tail of the
old farm horse, a neighbor came in to talk over the fall
pork and cider, and tell the news.</p>

<p>"Ef you want ter go over the hills and far away, Eli,
here's the chance. I see a man down to Woodtick who
was askin' ef I knew any likely young chap who'd like
to git 'scribers for a pious book he wants to sell. He'd
pay for the job when the names is got and the books
give out. That's ruther in your line, boy, so I calk'lated
your daddy would spare you, as you ain't much of a
hand at shuckin' corn nor cartin' pummace."</p>

<p>"Haw! haw!" laughed the big brothers, Ambrose
Vitruvius and Junius Solomon, as neighbor Terry
spoke with a sly twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>But the sisters, Miranda and Pamela, smiled for joy,
while the good mother stopped her busy wheel to listen
eagerly. Eli laid down his fiddle and came to the
hearth where the others sat, with such a wide-awake
expression on his usually thoughtful face that it was
plain that he liked the idea.</p>

<p>"I'll do it, if father'll let me," he said, looking wistfully
at the industrious man, who was shaving axe-handles
for the winter wood-chopping, after his day's
work was over.</p>

<p>"Wal, I can spare you for a week, mebby. It's not
time for the clock shop yet, and sence you've heerd o'
this, you won't do your chores right, so you may as
wal see what you can make of peddlin'."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir; I'll give you all I get, to pay for
my time," began Eli, glowing with pleasure at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
prospect of seeing a little of the world; for one of his
most cherished dreams was to cross the blue hills that
hemmed him in, and find what lay beyond.</p>

<p>"Guess I can afford to give you all you'll make
this trip," answered his father, in a tone that made
the brothers laugh again.</p>

<p>"Boys, don't pester Eli. Every one hasn't a call
to farmin', and it's wal to foller the leadin's of Providence
when they come along," said the mother, stroking
the smooth, brown head at her knee; for Eli always
went to her footstool with his sorrows and his joys.</p>

<p>So it was settled, and next day the boy, in his
home-spun and home-made Sunday best, set off to see
his employer and secure the job. He got it, and for
three days trudged up and down the steep roads, calling
at every house with a sample of his book, the Rev.
John Flavel's treatise on "Keeping the Heart." Eli's
winning face, modest manner, and earnest voice served
him well, and he got many names; for books were
scarce in those days, and a pious work was a treasure
to many a good soul who found it difficult to keep the
heart strong and cheerful in troublous times.</p>

<p>Then the books were to be delivered, and, anxious
to save his small earnings, Eli hired no horse to transport
his load, but borrowed a stout, green shawl from
his mother, and, with his pack on his back, marched
bravely away to finish his task. His wages were
spent in a new prayer-book for his mother, smart
handkerchief-pins for the faithful sisters, and a good
store of paper for himself.</p>

<p>This trip was so successful that he was seized with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
a strong desire to try a more ambitious and extended
one; for these glimpses of the world showed him how
much he had to learn, and how pleasantly he could
pick up knowledge in these flights.</p>

<p>"What be you a-brewdin' over now, boy? Gettin'
ready for the clock shop? It's 'most time for winter
work, and Terry says you do pretty wal at puttin'
together," said the farmer, a day or two after the
boy's return, as they sat at dinner, all helping themselves
from the large pewter platter heaped with pork
and vegetables.</p>

<p>"I was wishin' I could go South with Gad Upson.
He's been twice with clocks and notions, and wants a
mate. Hoadley fits him out and pays him a good
share if he does well. Couldn't I go along? I hate
that old shop, and I know I can do something better
than put together the insides of cheap clocks."</p>

<p>Eli spoke eagerly, and gave his mother an imploring
look which brought her to second the motion at once,
her consent having been already won.</p>

<p>The brothers stared as if Eli had proposed to go up
in a balloon, for to them the South seemed farther off
than Africa does nowadays. The father had evidently
been secretly prepared, for he showed no surprise, and
merely paused a moment to look at his ambitious son
with a glance in which amusement and reproach were
mingled.</p>

<p>"When a hen finds she's hatched a duck's egg, it's
no use for her to cackle; that ducklin' will take to the
water in spite on her, and paddle off, nobody knows
where. Go ahead, boy, and when you get enough of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
junketin' 'round the world, come home and fall to
work."</p>

<p>"Then I <i>may</i> go?" cried Eli, upsetting his mug of
cider in his excitement.</p>

<p>His father nodded, being too busy eating cabbage
with a wide-bladed green-handled knife to speak just
then. Eli, red and speechless with delight and gratitude,
could only sit and beam at his family till a sob
drew his attention to sister Pamela, whose pet he was.</p>

<p>"Don't, Pam, don't! I'll come back all right, and
bring you news and all the pretty things I can. I
<i>must</i> go; I feel as if I couldn't breathe, shut up here
winters. I s'pose it's wicked, but I can't help it,"
whispered Eli, with his arm around his buxom eighteen-year
old sister, who laid her head on his shoulder
and held him tight.</p>

<p>"Daughter, it's sinful to repine at the ways of
Providence. I see a leadin' plain in this, and ef <i>I</i> can
be chirk when my dear boy is goin', 'pears to me you
ought to keep a taut rein on your feelin's, and not
spile his pleasure."</p>

<p>The good mother's eyes were full of tears as she
spoke, but she caught up the end of her short gown
and wiped them quickly away to smile on Eli, who
thanked her with a loving look.</p>

<p>"It's so lonesome when he's not here. What will
we do evenings without the fiddle, or Eli to read a
piece in some of his books while we spin?" said poor
Pam, ashamed of her grief, yet glad to hide her tears
by affecting to settle the long wooden bodkin that
held up her coils of brown hair.</p>

<p>"Obed Finch will be comin' along, I guess likely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and he'll read to you out uv Eli's book about keepin'
the heart, and you'll find your'n gone 'fore you know
it," said Junius Solomon, in a tone that made pretty
Pam blush and run away, while the rest laughed at
her confusion.</p>

<p>So it was settled, and when all was ready, the boy
came home to show his equipment before he started.
A very modest outfit,&mdash;only two tin trunks slung
across the shoulders, filled with jewelry, combs, lace,
essences, and small wares.</p>

<p>"I hate to have ye go, son, but it's better than to
be mopin' to hum, gettin' desperut for books and rilin'
father. We'll all be workin' for ye, so be chipper and
do wal. Keep steddy, and don't disgrace your folks.
The Lord bless ye, my dear boy, and hold ye in the
holler of his hand!"</p>

<p>Her own rough hand was on his head as his
mother spoke, with wet eyes, and the tall lad
kissed her tenderly, whispering, with a choke in his
throat:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-by, mammy dear; I'll remember."</p>

<p>Then he tramped away to join his mate, turning
now and then to nod and smile and show a ruddy
face full of happiness, while the family watched
him out of sight with mingled hopes and doubts and
fears.</p>

<p>Mails were slow in those days, but at length a
letter came; and here it is,&mdash;a true copy of one
written by a boy in 1820:&mdash;
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>


<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">Norfolk, Va.</span>, December 4th.<br /></div>


<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Honored Parents</span>: I write to inform you I am
safe here and to work. Our business is profitable, and
I am fast learning the Quirks and Turns of trade.
We are going to the eastern shore of Va., calculating
to be gone six weeks. The inhabitants are sociable
and hospitable, and you need not fear I shall suffer,
for I find many almost fathers and mothers among
these good folks.</p>

<p>"Taking our trunks, we travel through the country,
entering the houses of the rich and poor, offering
our goods, and earning our wages by the sweat of our
brows. How do you think we look? Like two Awkward,
Homespun, Tugging Yankee peddlers? No,
that is not the case. By people of breeding we are
treated with politeness and gentility, and the low and
vulgar we do not seek. For my part, I enjoy travelling
more than I expected. Conversation with new
folks, observing manners and customs, and seeing the
world, does me great good.</p>

<p>"I never met a real gentleman till I came here.
Their hospitality allows me to see and copy their fine
ways of acting and speaking, and they put the most
Bashful at ease. Gad likes the maids and stays in the
kitchen most times. I get into the libraries and read
when we put up nights, and the ladies are most kind
to me everywhere.</p>

<p>"I'm so tall they can't believe I'm only sixteen.
They aren't as pretty as our rosy-faced girls, but
their ways are elegant, and so are their clothes, tell
Pam.</p>

<p>"When I think how kind you were to let me come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
I am full of gratitude. I made some verses, one day,
as I waited in a hovel for the rain to hold up.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In reply to this, came a letter from the anxious
mother, which shows not only the tender, pious nature
of the good woman, but also how much need of
education the boy had, and how well he was doing for
himself:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Affectionate Son</span>: We was very glad to receave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
your letter. I feal very anctious about you this winter,
and how you are a doing. You cannot know a
mother's concern for her boy wen he is fur away. Do
not git into bad habbits. Take the Bible for your rule
and guide to vartue. I pray for your prosperity in all
spiritall and temporrall things, and leave you in the care
of Him who gave you breath and will keep you safe.</p>

<p>"We are all well, and your father enjoys his helth
better than last year. I visited Uncle Medad a spell
last week. I am provided with a horse and shay to
ride to meatin. Mr. Eben Welton took our cow and

was excommunicated last Sabbath. Pamely goes away
to learn dressmakin soon. I mistrust Mirandy will
take up with Pennel Haskell; he is likely, and comes
frequent. I wish you had been here a Christmas.
We had a large company to dinner, and I got some
wheat flower and made a fine chicken pye. Eli, I
hope you attend meatin when you can. Do not trifle
away the holy day in vane pleasures, but live to the
glory of God, and in the fear of your parents. Father
sold the white colt. He was too spirity, and upsat

<p>"P. S.&mdash;Liddy Finch is married. Our pigs give us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
nine hunderd pound of prime pork."</p></blockquote>

<p>Many such letters went to and fro that winter, and
Eli faithfully reported all his adventures. For he had
many, and once or twice was in danger of losing his
life.</p>

<p>On one occasion, having parted from his mate for a
day or two, wishing to try his luck alone, our young
peddler found himself, late in the afternoon, approaching
the Dismal Swamp. A tempest arose, adding to
the loneliness and terror of the hour. The cypresses
uprooted by the blast fell now and then across the
road, endangering the poor boy's head. A sluggish
stream rolled through tangled junipers and beds of
reeds, and the fen on either side was full of ugly
creatures, lizards, snakes, and toads; while owls, scared
by the storm, flew wildly about and hooted dismally.
Just at the height of the tumult, Eli saw three men
coming toward him, and gladly hastened to meet them,
hoping to have their company or learn of them where
he could find a shelter. But their bad faces daunted
him, and he would have hurried by without speaking
if they had not stopped him, roughly demanding his
name and business.</p>

<p>The tall stripling was brave, but his youthful face
showed him to be but a boy, and the consciousness of
a well-filled purse in his pocket made him anxious to
escape. So he answered briefly, and tried to go on.
But two men held him, in spite of his struggles, while
the third rifled his pockets, broke open his trunks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
took all that was of any value in the way of watches
and jewelry. Then they left him, with a cruel joke
about a good journey, and made off with their booty.
It was the first time poor Eli had met with such a
mishap, and as he stood in the rain looking at his
wares scattered about the road, he felt inclined to
throw himself into the creek, and forget his woes there
among the frogs and snakes. But he had a stout
heart, and soon decided to make the best of it, since
nothing could be done to mend the matter. Gathering
up his bedraggled laces, scattered scent-bottles, and
dirty buttons, pins, and needles, he trudged sadly
on, feeling that for him this was indeed a Dismal
Swamp.</p>

<p>"I told you we'd better stick together, but you
wanted to be so dre'dful smart, and go travellin' off
alone in them out'n the way places. Might 'a' known
you'd get overhauled somers. I always did think you
was a gump, Eli, and now I'm sure on't," was all the
comfort Gad gave him when they met, and the direful
tale was told.</p>

<p>"What shall I do now?" asked the poor lad. "My
notions aren't worth selling, and my money's gone.
I'll have to pay Hoadley somehow."</p>

<p>"You'd better foot it home and go to choppin' punkins
for the cows, or help your marm spin. I vow I
never did see such a chap for gettin' into a mess,"
scolded Gad, who was a true Yankee, and made a successful
trader, even in a small way.</p>

<p>"We'll sleep on it," said Eli, gently, and went to
bed very low in his mind.</p>

<p>Perhaps a few tears wet his pillow as he lay awake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and the prayers his mother taught him were whispered
in the silence of the night; for hope revived, comfort
came, and in the morning his serene face and sensible
plan proved to his irate friend that the "gump" had
a wise head and a manly heart, after all.</p>

<p>"Gad, it is just the time for the new almanacs, and
Allen wants men to sell 'em. I thought it was small
business before, but beggars mustn't be choosers, so
I'm going right off to offer for the job 'round here.
It will do for a start, and if I'm smart, Allen will give
me a better chance maybe."</p>

<p>"That's a fust-rate plan. Go ahead, and I'll say a
good word for you. Allen knows me, and books is in
your line, so I guess you'll do wal if you keep out'n
the mashes," answered Gad, with great good will, having
slept off his vexation.</p>

<p>The plan did go well, and for weeks the rosy-faced,
gentle-voiced youth might have been seen mildly offering
the new almanacs at doors and shops, and at street
corners, with a wistful look in his blue eyes, and a
courtesy of manner that attracted many customers and
earned many a dollar. Several mates, envying his
fine handwriting and pitying his hard luck, took lessons
in penmanship of him and paid him fairly, whereat he
rejoiced over the hours spent at home, flat on the
kitchen floor, or flourishing splendid capitals on the
snow-banks, when his nose was blue with cold and his
hands half-frozen.</p>

<p>When the season for the yellow-covered almanacs
was over, Eli, having won the confidence of his employer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was fitted out with more notions, and again set
forth on his travels, armed, this time, and in company
with his townsman. He prospered well, and all winter
trudged to and fro, seemingly a common peddler, but
really a student, making the world his book, and bent
on learning all he could. Travel taught him geography
and history, for he soon knew every corner of Virginia;
looked longingly at the ancient walls of William and
Mary College, where Jefferson and Monroe studied;
where young George Washington received his surveyor's
commission, and in his later years served as Chancellor.
In Yorktown, he heard all about the siege of
1781; saw Lord Cornwallis's lodgings and the cave
named for him; met pleasant people, whose fine speech
and manners he carefully copied; read excellent books
wherever he could find them, and observed, remembered,
and stored away all that he saw, heard, and
learned, to help and adorn his later life.</p>

<p>By spring he set out for home, having slowly saved
enough to repay Hoadley for the lost goods. But as if
Providence meant to teach him another lesson, and
make him still more prudent, humble, and manly, a
sad adventure befell him on his way.</p>

<p>While waiting for the coaster that was to take them
home, he one day went in swimming with Gad; for
this was one of the favorite pastimes of the Connecticut
boys, who on Saturday nights congregated by the
score at a pond called Benson's Pot, and leaped from
the spring-board like circus tumblers, turning somersaults
into the deep water below.</p>

<p>It was too early for such sport now; the water was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
very cold, and poor Gad, taken with cramp, nearly
drowned Eli by clinging to his legs as he went down.
Freeing himself with difficulty, Eli tried to save his
friend; but the current swept the helpless man away,
and he was lost. Hurriedly dressing, Eli ran for aid,
but found himself regarded with suspicion by those to
whom he told his story; for he was a stranger in the
place and certain peddlers who had gone before had
left a bad name behind them.</p>

<p>To his horror, he was arrested, accused of murder,
and would have been tried for his life, if Mr. Allen of
Norfolk had not come to testify to his good character,
and set him free. Poor Gad's body was found and
buried, and after a month's delay, Eli set out again,
alone, heavy-hearted, and very poor, for all his own
little savings had been consumed by various expenses.
Mr. Hoadley's money was untouched, but not increased,
as he hoped to have it; and rather than borrow a
penny of it, Eli landed barefooted. His boots were so
old he threw them overboard, and spent his last dollar
for a cheap pair of shoes to wear when he appeared
at home, for they were not stout enough to stand
travel. So, like Franklin with his rolls, the lad ate
crackers and cheese as he trudged through the city,
and set out for the far-away farm-house among the
hills.</p>

<p>A long journey, but a pleasant one, in spite of his
troubles; for spring made the world lovely, habit
made walking no hardship, and all he had seen in his
wanderings passed before him at will, like a panorama
full of color and variety.</p>

<p>Letters had gone before, but it was a sad homecoming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and when all was told, Eli said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, father, I'll go to work. I've had my wish
and enjoyed it a sight; and would go again, but I
feel as if I ought to work, as long as I can't pay for
my time."</p>

<p>"That's hearty, son, and I'm obleeged to ye. Hear
what mother's got to say, and then do whichever you
prefer," answered the farmer, with a nod toward his
wife, who, with the girls, seemed full of some pleasant
news which they longed to tell.</p>

<p>"I've sold all the cloth we made last winter for a
good sum, and father says you may hev the spendin'
on't. It will be enough to pay your board down
to Uncle Tillotson's while you study with him, so
's 't you kin be gettin' ready for college next year.
I've sot my heart on't, and you musn't disapp'int
me and the girls," said the good woman, with a face
full of faith and pride in her boy, in spite of all
mishaps.</p>

<p>"Oh, mammy, how good you be! It don't seem
as if I ought to take it. But I <i>do</i> want to go!" cried
Eli, catching her round the neck in an ecstasy of
boyish delight and gratitude.</p>

<p>Here Miranda and Pamela appeared, bringing their
homely gifts of warm hose, and new shirts made from
wool and flax grown by the father, and spun and woven
by the accomplished housewife.</p>

<p>A very happy youth was Eli when he again set off
to the city, with his humble outfit and slender purse,
though father still looked doubtful, and the brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
were more sure than ever that Eli was a fool to prefer
dry books to country work and fun.</p>

<p>A busy year followed, Eli studying, as never boy
studied before, with the excellent minister, who soon
grew proud of his best pupil. Less preparation was
needed in those days, and perhaps more love and
industry went to the work; for necessity is a stern
master, and poor boys often work wonders if the spark
of greatness is there.</p>

<p>Eli had his wish in time, and went to college,
mother and sisters making it possible by the sale of
their handiwork; for the girls were famous spinners,
and the mother the best weaver in the country around.
How willingly they toiled for Eli!&mdash;rising early and
sitting late, cheering their labor with loving talk of
the dear lad's progress, and an unfailing faith in his
future success. Many a long ride did that good
mother take to the city, miles away, with a great roll
of cloth on the pillion behind her to sell, that she
might pay her son's college bills. Many a coveted
pleasure did the faithful sisters give up that they
might keep Eli well clothed, or send him some country
dainty to cheer the studies which seemed to them
painfully hard and mysteriously precious. Father
began to take pride in the ugly duckling now, and
brothers to brag of his great learning. Neighbors
came in to hear his letters, and when vacation brought
him home, the lads and lasses regarded him with a
certain awe; for his manners were better, his language
purer, than theirs, and the new life he led refined the
country boy till he seemed a gentleman.</p>

<p>The second year he yielded to temptation, and got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
into debt. Being anxious to do credit to his family,
of whom he was secretly a little ashamed about this
time, he spent money on his clothes, conscious that
he was a comely youth with a great love of beauty,
and a longing for all that cultivates and embellishes
character and life. An elegant gentleman astonished
the hill folk that season, by appearing at the little
church in a suit such as the greatest rustic dandy
never imagined in his wildest dreams,&mdash;the tall white
hat with rolling brim, Marseilles vest with watch-chain
and seals festooned across it, the fine blue coat with
its brass buttons, and the nankeen trousers strapped
over boots so tight that it was torture to walk in
them. Armed with a cane in the well-gloved hand,
an imposing brooch in the frills of the linen shirt,
Eli sauntered across the green, the observed of all
observers, proudly hoping that the blue eyes of a
certain sweet Lucinda were fixed admiringly upon
him.</p>

<p>The boys were the first to recover from the shock,
and promptly resented the transformation of their
former butt into a city beau, by jeering openly and
affecting great scorn of the envied splendor. The poor
jackdaw, somewhat abashed at the effect of his plumes,
tried to prove that he felt no superiority, by being
very affable, which won the lasses, but failed to soften
the hearts of the boys; and when he secured the belle
of the village for the Thanksgiving drive and dance,
the young men resolved that pride should have a
fall.</p>

<p>Arrayed in all his finery, Eli drove pretty Lucinda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
in a smart borrowed wagon to the tavern where the
dance was held. Full of the airs and graces he had
learned at college, the once bashful, awkward Eli was
the admired of all eyes, as he pranced down the long
contra-dance in the agonizing boots, or played "threading
the needle" without the least reluctance on the
part of the blushing girls to pay the fine of a kiss
when the players sung the old rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The needle's eye no one can pass;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The thread that runs so true&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It has caught many a pretty lass,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now it has caught you."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But his glory was short-lived; for some enemy
maliciously drew out the linchpin from the smart
wagon, and as they were gayly driving homeward
over the hills, the downfall came, and out they both
went, to the great damage of Eli's city suit, and poor
Lucinda's simple finery.</p>

<p>Fortunately, no bones were broken, and picking
themselves up, they sadly footed it home, hoping the
mishap would remain unknown. But the rogues took
care that Eli should not escape, and the whole neighborhood
laughed over the joke; for the fine hat was
ruined, and the costly coat split down the back, in the
ignominious tumble.</p>

<p>Great was the humiliation of the poor student; for
not only was he ridiculed, but Lucinda would not
forgive him, and the blue eyes smiled upon another;
worst of all, he had to confess his debts and borrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
money of his father to pay them. He meekly bore
the stern rebuke that came with the hard-earned dollars,
but the sight of the tears his mother shed, even
while she comforted him, filled him with remorse. He
went back to his books, in a homespun suit, a sadder
and a wiser boy, and fell to work as if resolved to wash
out past errors and regain the confidence he had lost.</p>

<p>All that winter the wheels turned and the loom
jangled, that the rolls of cloth might be increased; and
never was the day too cold, the way too long, for the
good mother's pious pilgrimage.</p>

<p>That summer, a man came home to them, shabby
enough as to his clothes, but so wonderfully improved
in other ways, that not only did the women folk glow
with tender pride, but father and brothers looked at
him with respect, and owned at last there was something
in Eli. "No vacation for me," he said; "I
must work to pay my debts; and as I am not of much
use here, I'll try my old plan, and peddle some money
into my empty pockets."</p>

<p>It was both comic and pathetic to see the shoulders
that had worn the fine broadcloth burdened with a
yoke, the hands that had worn kid gloves grasping
the tin trunks, and the dapper feet trudging through
dust and dew in cow-hide boots. But the face under
the old straw hat was a manlier one than that which
the tall beaver crowned, and the heart under the
rough vest was far happier than when the gold chain
glittered above it. He did so well that when he
returned to college his debts were paid, and the family
faith in Eli restored.</p>

<p>That was an eventful year; for one brother married,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and one went off to seek his fortune, the father mortgaging
his farm to give these sons a fair start in life. Eli was
to be a minister, and the farmer left his fortunes in the
hands of his wife, who, like many another good mother,
was the making of the great man of the family, and was
content with that knowledge, leaving him the glory.</p>

<p>The next year, Eli graduated with honor, and went
home, to be received with great rejoicing, just twenty-one,
and a free man. He had longed for this time,
and planned a happy, studious life, preparing to preach
the gospel in a little parsonage of his own. But suddenly
all was changed; joy turned to sorrow, hope to
doubt, and Eli was called to relinquish liberty for
duty,&mdash;to give up his own dreams of a home, to keep a
roof over the heads of the dear mother and the faithful
sisters. His father died suddenly, leaving very little
for the women folk besides the independence that lay
in the skill of their own thrifty hands. The elder
brothers could not offer much help, and Eli was the
one to whom the poor souls turned in their hour of
sorrow and anxiety.</p>

<p>"Go on, dear, and don't pester yourself about us.
We can find food and firin' here as long as the old
farm is ours. I guess we can manage to pay off the
mortgage by-and-by. It don't seem as if I <i>could</i> turn
out, after livin' here ever sense I was married, and
poor father so fond on't."</p>

<p>The widow covered her face with her apron, and Eli
put his arms about her, saying manfully, as he gave
up all his fondest hopes for her dearer sake&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cheer up, mother, and trust to me. I should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
a poor fellow if I allowed you and the girls to want,
after all you've done for me. I can get a school, and
earn instead of spend. Teaching and studying can
go on together. I'm sure I shouldn't prosper if I
shirked my duty, and I won't." The three sad women
clung to him, and the brothers, looking at his brave,
bright face, felt that Eli was indeed a man to lean on
and to love in times like this.</p>

<p>"Well," thought the young philosopher, "the Lord
knows what is best for me, and perhaps this is a part
of my education. I'll try to think so, and hope to
get some good out of a hard job."</p>

<p>In this spirit he set about teaching, and prospered
wonderfully, for his own great love of learning made
it an easy and delightful task to help others as he had
longed to be helped. His innocent and tender nature
made all children love him, and gave him a remarkable
power over them; so when the first hard months were
past, and his efforts began to bear fruit, he found that
what had seemed an affliction was a blessing, and that
teaching was his special gift. Filial duty sweetened
the task, a submissive heart found happiness in self-sacrifice,
and a wise soul showed him what a noble and
lovely work it was to minister to little children,&mdash;for
of such is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>For years Eli taught, and his school grew famous;
for he copied the fashions of other countries, invented
new methods, and gave himself so entirely to his
profession that he could not fail of success. The mortgage
was paid off, and Eli made frequent pilgrimages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to the dear old mother, whose staff and comfort he
still was. The sisters married well, the brothers
prospered, and at thirty, the schoolmaster found a
nobler mate than pretty Lucinda, and soon had some
little pupils of his very own to love and teach.</p>

<p>There his youth ends; but after the years of teaching
he began to preach at last, not in one pulpit, but
in many all over the land, diffusing good thoughts now
as he had peddled small wares when a boy; still learning
as he went, still loving books and studying mankind,
still patient, pious, dutiful, and tender, a wise
and beautiful old man, till, at eighty, Eli's education
ended.<br /></p>

<h2><a name="Onawandah" id="Onawandah"></a>Onawandah</h2>


<p>"What in the world have <i>I</i> chosen?" exclaimed
Geoff, as he drew out a manuscript in his turn and read
the queer name.</p>

<p>"A story that will just suit you, I think. The hero
is an Indian, and a brave one, as you will see. I learned
the little tale from an old woman who lived in the valley
of the Connecticut, which the Indians called the
Long River of Pines."</p>

<p>With this very short preface, Aunt Elinor began to
read, in her best manner, the story of</p>

<h4>ONAWANDAH.</h4>

<p>Long ago,&mdash;when hostile Indians haunted the great
forests, and every settlement had its fort for the protection
of the inhabitants,&mdash;in one of the towns on the
Connecticut River, lived Parson Bain and his little son
and daughter. The wife and mother was dead; but
an old servant took care of them, and did her best to
make Reuben and Eunice good children. Her direst
threat, when they were naughty, was, "The Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
will come and fetch you, if you don't behave." So they
grew up in great fear of the red men. Even the
friendly Indians, who sometimes came for food or
powder, were regarded with suspicion by the people.
No man went to work without his gun near by. On
Sundays, when they trudged to the rude meeting-house,
all carried the trusty rifle on the shoulder;
and while the pastor preached, a sentinel mounted
guard at the door, to give warning if canoes came
down the river or a dark face peered from the wood.</p>

<p>One autumn night, when the first heavy rains were
falling and a cold wind whistled through the valley, a
knock came at the minister's door, and, opening it, he
found an Indian boy, ragged, hungry, and foot-sore, who
begged for food and shelter. In his broken way, he
told how he had fallen ill, and been left to die by enemies
who had taken him from his own people, months
before; how he had wandered for days till almost
sinking; and that he had come now to ask for help,
led by the hospitable light in the parsonage window.</p>

<p>"Send him away, master, or harm will come of it.
He is a spy, and we shall all be scalped by the murdering
Injuns who are waiting in the wood," said old
Becky, harshly; while little Eunice hid in the old servant's
ample skirts, and twelve-year-old Reuben laid
his hand on his cross-bow, ready to defend his sister if
need be.</p>

<p>But the good man drew the poor lad in, saying, with
his friendly smile: "Shall not a Christian be as hospitable
as a godless savage? Come in, child, and be fed:
you sorely need rest and shelter."</p>

<p>Leaving his face to express the gratitude he had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
words to tell, the boy sat by the comfortable fire and
ate like a famished wolf, while Becky muttered her
forebodings and the children eyed the dark youth at a
safe distance. Something in his pinched face, wounded
foot, and eyes full of dumb pain and patience, touched
the little girl's tender heart, and, yielding to a pitiful
impulse, she brought her own basin of new milk and,
setting it beside the stranger, ran to hide behind her
father, suddenly remembering that this was one of the
dreaded Indians.</p>

<p>"That was well done, little daughter. Thou shalt
love thine enemies, and share thy bread with the needy.
See, he is smiling; that pleased him, and he wishes us
to be his friends."</p>

<p>But Eunice ventured no more that night, and quaked
in her little bed at the thought of the strange boy
sleeping on a blanket before the fire below. Reuben
hid his fears better, and resolved to watch while others
slept; but was off as soon as his curly head touched
the pillow, and dreamed of tomahawks and war-whoops
till morning.</p>

<p>Next day, neighbors came to see the waif, and one
and all advised sending him away as soon as possible,
since he was doubtless a spy, as Becky said, and would
bring trouble of some sort.</p>

<p>"When he is well, he may go whithersoever he
will; but while he is too lame to walk, weak with
hunger, and worn out with weariness, I will harbor
him. He cannot feign suffering and starvation like
this. I shall do my duty, and leave the consequences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to the Lord," answered the parson, with such pious
firmness that the neighbors said no more.</p>

<p>But they kept a close watch upon Onawandah,
when he went among them, silent and submissive, but
with the proud air of a captive prince, and sometimes
a fierce flash in his black eyes when the other lads
taunted him with his red skin. He was very lame
for weeks, and could only sit in the sun, weaving
pretty baskets for Eunice, and shaping bows and
arrows for Reuben. The children were soon his
friends, for with them he was always gentle, trying
in his soft language and expressive gestures to show
his good-will and gratitude; for they defended him
against their ruder playmates, and, following their
father's example, trusted and cherished the homeless
youth.</p>

<p>When he was able to walk, he taught the boy to
shoot and trap the wild creatures of the wood, to find
fish where others failed, and to guide himself in the
wilderness by star and sun, wind and water. To
Eunice he brought little offerings of bark and feathers;
taught her to make moccasins of skin, belts of shells,
or pouches gay with porcupine quills and colored
grass. He would not work for old Becky,&mdash;who
plainly showed her distrust,&mdash;saying: "A brave does
not grind corn and bring wood; that is squaw's work.
Onawandah will hunt and fish and fight for you, but
no more." And even the request of the parson could
not win obedience in this, though the boy would have
died for the good man.</p>

<p>"We can not tame an eagle as we can a barnyard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
fowl. Let him remember only kindness of us, and so
we turn a foe into a friend," said Parson Bain, stroking
the sleek, dark head, that always bowed before
him, with a docile reverence shown to no other living
creature.</p>

<p>Winter came, and the settlers fared hardly through
the long months, when the drifts rose to the eaves of
their low cabins, and the stores, carefully harvested,
failed to supply even their simple wants. But the
minister's family never lacked wild meat, for Onawandah
proved himself a better hunter than any man in
the town; and the boy of sixteen led the way on his
snow-shoes when they went to track a bear to its den,
chase the deer for miles, or shoot the wolves that
howled about their homes in the winter nights.</p>

<p>But he never joined in their games, and sat apart
when the young folk made merry, as if he scorned
such childish pastimes and longed to be a man in all
things. Why he stayed when he was well again, no
one could tell, unless he waited for spring to make his
way to his own people. But Reuben and Eunice
rejoiced to keep him; for while he taught them many
things, he was their pupil also, learning English
rapidly, and proving himself a very affectionate and
devoted friend and servant, in his own quiet way.</p>

<p>"Be of good cheer, little daughter; I shall be gone
but three days, and our brave Onawandah will guard
you well," said the parson, one April morning, as he
mounted his horse to visit a distant settlement, where
the bitter winter had brought sickness and death to
more than one household.</p>

<p>The boy showed his white teeth in a bright smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
as he stood beside the children, while Becky croaked,
with a shake of the head:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope you mayn't find you've warmed a viper
in your bosom, master."</p>

<p>Two days later, it seemed as if Becky was a true
prophet, and that the confiding minister <i>had</i> been
terribly deceived; for Onawandah went away to hunt,
and that night the awful war-whoop woke the sleeping
villagers, to find their houses burning, while the
hidden Indians shot at them by the light of the fires
kindled by dusky scouts. In terror and confusion the
whites flew to the fort; and, while the men fought
bravely, the women held blankets to catch arrows and
bullets, or bound up the hurts of their defenders.</p>

<p>It was all over by daylight, and the red men sped
away up the river, with several prisoners, and such
booty as they could plunder from the deserted houses.
Not till all fear of a return of their enemies was over,
did the poor people venture to leave the fort and seek
their ruined homes. Then it was discovered that Becky
and the parson's children were gone, and great was
the bewailing, for the good man was much beloved by
all his flock.</p>

<p>Suddenly the smothered voice of Becky was heard
by a party of visitors, calling dolefully:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am here, betwixt the beds. Pull me out, neighbors,
for I am half dead with fright and smothering."</p>

<p>The old woman was quickly extricated from her
hiding-place, and with much energy declared that
she had seen Onawandah, disguised with war-paint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
among the Indians, and that he had torn away the
children from her arms before she could fly from the
house.</p>

<p>"He chose his time well, when they were defenceless,
dear lambs! Spite of all my warnings, master
trusted him, and this is the thanks we get. Oh,
my poor master! How can I tell him this heavy
news?"</p>

<p>There was no need to tell it; for, as Becky sat
moaning and beating her breast on the fireless hearth,
and the sympathizing neighbors stood about her, the
sound of a horse's hoofs was heard, and the parson
came down the hilly road like one riding for his life.
He had seen the smoke afar off, guessed the sad truth,
and hurried on, to find his home in ruins, and to learn
by his first glance at the faces around him that his
children were gone.</p>

<p>When he had heard all there was to tell, he sat
down upon his door-stone with his head in his hands,
praying for strength to bear a grief too deep for words.
The wounded and weary men tried to comfort him
with hope, and the women wept with him as they
hugged their own babies closer to the hearts that
ached for the lost children. Suddenly a stir went
through the mournful group, as Onawandah came
from the wood with a young deer upon his shoulders,
and amazement in his face as he saw the desolation
before him. Dropping his burden, he stood an instant
looking with eyes that kindled fiercely; then he came
bounding toward them, undaunted by the hatred, suspicion,
and surprise plainly written on the countenances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
before him. He missed his playmates, and asked but
one question:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The boy, the little squaw,&mdash;where gone?"</p>

<p>His answer was a rough one, for the men seized
him and poured forth the tale, heaping reproaches
upon him for such treachery and ingratitude. He
bore it all in proud silence till they pointed to the
poor father, whose dumb sorrow was more eloquent
than all their wrath. Onawandah looked at him, and
the fire died out of his eyes as if quenched by the
tears he would not shed. Shaking off the hands that
held him, he went to his good friend, saying with
passionate earnestness:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Onawandah is <i>not</i> traitor! Onawandah remembers!
Onawandah grateful! You believe?"</p>

<p>The poor parson looked up at him, and could not
doubt his truth; for genuine love and sorrow ennobled
the dark face, and he had never known the boy
to lie.</p>

<p>"I believe and trust you still, but others will not.
Go, you are no longer safe here, and I have no home
to offer you," said the parson, sadly, feeling that he
cared for none, unless his children were restored
to him.</p>

<p>"Onawandah has no fear. He goes; but he comes
again to bring the boy, the little squaw."</p>

<p>Few words, but they were so solemnly spoken that
the most unbelieving were impressed; for the youth
laid one hand on the gray head bowed before him,
and lifted the other toward heaven, as if calling the
Great Spirit to hear his vow.</p>

<p>A relenting murmur went through the crowd, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the boy paid no heed, as he turned away, and with
no arms but his hunting knife and bow, no food but
such as he could find, no guide but the sun by day,
the stars by night, plunged into the pathless forest
and was gone.</p>

<p>Then the people drew a long breath, and muttered
to one another:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He will never do it, yet he is a brave lad for his
years."</p>

<p>"Only a shift to get off with a whole skin, I
warrant you. These varlets are as cunning as foxes,"
added Becky, sourly.</p>

<p>The parson alone believed and hoped, though weeks
and months went by, and his children did not come.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Meantime, Reuben and Eunice were far away in
an Indian camp, resting as best they could, after the
long journey that followed that dreadful night. Their
captors were not cruel to them, for Reuben was a
stout fellow, and, thanks to Onawandah, could hold
his own with the boys who would have tormented him
if he had been feeble or cowardly. Eunice also was a
hardy creature for her years, and when her first
fright and fatigue were over, made herself useful in
many ways among the squaws, who did not let the
pretty child suffer greatly; though she was neglected,
because they knew no better.</p>

<p>Life in a wigwam was not a life of ease, and fortunately
the children were accustomed to simple habits
and the hardships that all endured in those early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
times. But they mourned for home till their young
faces were pathetic with the longing, and their pillows
of dry leaves were often wet with tears in the
night. Their clothes grew ragged, their hair unkempt,
their faces tanned by sun and wind. Scanty food and
exposure to all weathers tried the strength of their
bodies, and uncertainty as to their fate saddened their
spirits; yet they bore up bravely, and said their
prayers faithfully, feeling sure that God would bring
them home to father in His own good time.</p>

<p>One day, when Reuben was snaring birds in the
wood,&mdash;for the Indians had no fear of such young
children venturing to escape,&mdash;he heard the cry of a
quail, and followed it deeper and deeper into the
forest, till it ceased, and, with a sudden rustle,
Onawandah rose up from the brakes, his finger on
his lips to prevent any exclamation that might betray
him to other ears and eyes.</p>

<p>"I come for you and little Laroka" (the name he
gave Eunice, meaning "Wild Rose"). "I take you
home. Not know me yet. Go and wait."</p>

<p>He spoke low and fast; but the joy in his face told
how glad he was to find the boy after his long search,
and Reuben clung to him, trying not to disgrace himself
by crying like a girl, in his surprise and delight.</p>

<p>Lying hidden in the tall brakes they talked in whispers,
while one told of the capture, and the other of a
plan of escape; for, though a friendly tribe, these Indians
were not Onawandah's people, and they must not
suspect that he knew the children, else they might be
separated at once.</p>

<p>"Little squaw betray me. You watch her. Tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
her not to cry out, not speak me any time. When I
say come, we go&mdash;fast&mdash;in the night. Not ready
yet."</p>

<p>These were the orders Reuben received, and, when
he could compose himself, he went back to the wigwams,
leaving his friend in the wood, while he told the good
news to Eunice, and prepared her for the part she must
play.</p>

<p>Fear had taught her self-control, and the poor child
stood the test well, working off her relief and rapture
by pounding corn on the stone mortar till her little
hands were blistered, and her arms ached for hours
afterward.</p>

<p>Not till the next day did Onawandah make his appearance,
and then he came limping into the village,
weary, lame, and half starved, after his long wandering
in the wilderness. He was kindly welcomed, and his
story believed; for he told only the first part, and said
nothing of his life among the white men. He hardly
glanced at the children when they were pointed out to
him by their captors, and scowled at poor Eunice, who
forgot her part in her joy, and smiled as she met the
dark eyes that till now had always looked kindly at
her. A touch from Reuben warned her, and she was
glad to hide her confusion by shaking her long hair
over her face, as if afraid of the stranger.</p>

<p>Onawandah took no further notice of them, but
seemed to be very lame with the old wound in his foot,
which prevented his being obliged to hunt with the
men. He was resting and slowly gathering strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
for the hard task he had set himself, while he waited
for a safe time to save the children. They understood,
but the suspense proved too much for little Eunice, and
she pined with impatience to be gone. She lost appetite
and color, and cast such appealing glances at Onawandah,
that he could not seem quite indifferent, and
gave her a soft word now and then, or did such acts
of kindness as he could perform unsuspected. When
she lay awake at night thinking of home, a cricket
would chirp outside the wigwam, and a hand slip in a
leaf full of berries, or a bark-cup of fresh water for
the feverish little mouth. Sometimes it was only a
caress or a whisper of encouragement, that re-assured
the childish heart, and sent her to sleep with a comfortable
sense of love and protection, like a sheltering
wing over a motherless bird.</p>

<p>Reuben stood it better, and entered heartily into the
excitement of the plot; for he had grown tall and strong
in these trying months, and felt that he must prove
himself a man to sustain and defend his sister. Quietly
he put away each day a bit of dried meat, a handful
of parched corn, or a well-sharpened arrowhead, as
provision for the journey; while Onawandah seemed
to be amusing himself with making moccasins and a
little vest of deer-skin for an Indian child about the
age of Eunice.</p>

<p>At last, in the early autumn, all the men went off on
the war-path, leaving only boys and women behind.
Then Onawandah's eyes began to kindle, and Reuben's
heart to beat fast, for both felt that their time for
escape had come.</p>

<p>All was ready, and one moonless night the signal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was given. A cricket chirped shrilly outside the tent
where the children slept with one old squaw. A strong
hand cut the skin beside their bed of fir-boughs, and
two trembling creatures crept out to follow the tall
shadow that flitted noiselessly before them into the
darkness of the wood. Not a broken twig, a careless
step, or a whispered word betrayed them, and they
vanished as swiftly and silently as hunted deer flying
for their lives.</p>

<p>Till dawn they hurried on, Onawandah carrying Eunice,
whose strength soon failed, and Reuben manfully
shouldering the hatchet and the pouch of food. At
sunrise they hid in a thicket by a spring and rested,
while waiting for the friendly night to come again.
Then they pushed on, and fear gave wings to their feet,
so that by another morning they were far enough away
to venture to travel more slowly and sleep at night.</p>

<p>If the children had learned to love and trust the
Indian boy in happier times, they adored him now, and
came to regard him as an earthly Providence; so faithful,
brave, and tender was he,&mdash;so forgetful of himself,
so bent on saving them. He never seemed to sleep,
ate the poorest morsels, or went without any food when
provision failed; let no danger daunt him, no hardship
wring complaint from him, but went on through the
wild forest, led by guides invisible to them, till they
began to hope that home was near.</p>

<p>Twice he saved their lives. Once, when he went
in search of food, leaving Reuben to guard his sister,
the children, being very hungry, ignorantly ate some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
poisonous berries which looked like wild cherries, and
were deliciously sweet. The boy generously gave
most of them to Eunice, and soon was terror-stricken
to see her grow pale, and cold, and deathly ill. Not
knowing what to do, he could only rub her hands and
call wildly for Onawandah.</p>

<p>The name echoed through the silent wood, and,
though far away, the keen ear of the Indian heard it,
his fleet feet brought him back in time, and his knowledge
of wild roots and herbs made it possible to save
the child when no other help was at hand.</p>

<p>"Make fire. Keep warm. I soon come," he said,
after hearing the story and examining Eunice, who
could only lift her eyes to him, full of childish confidence
and patience.</p>

<p>Then he was off again, scouring the woods like a
hound on the scent, searching everywhere for the
precious little herb that would counteract the poison.
Any one watching him would have thought him crazy,
as he rushed hither and thither, tearing up the leaves,
creeping on his hands and knees that it might not escape
him, and when he found it, springing up with a
cry that startled the birds, and carried hope to poor
Reuben, who was trying to forget his own pain in his
anxiety for Eunice, whom he thought dying.</p>

<p>"Eat, eat, while I make drink. All safe now," cried
Onawandah, as he came leaping toward them with his
hands full of green leaves, and his dark face shining
with joy.</p>

<p>The boy was soon relieved, but for hours they hung
over the girl, who suffered sadly, till she grew unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and lay as if dead. Reuben's courage failed
then, and he cried bitterly, thinking how hard it would
be to leave the dear little creature under the pines and
go home alone to father. Even Onawandah lost hope
for a while, and sat like a bronze statue of despair,
with his eyes fixed on his Wild Rose, who seemed fading
away too soon.</p>

<p>Suddenly he rose, stretched his arms to the west,
where the sun was setting splendidly, and in his own
musical language prayed to the Great Spirit. The
Christian boy fell upon his knees, feeling that the only
help was in the Father who saw and heard them even
in the wilderness. Both were comforted, and when
they turned to Eunice there was a faint tinge of color
on the pale cheeks, as if the evening red kissed her;
the look of pain was gone, and she slept quietly, without
the moans that had made their hearts ache before.</p>

<p>"He hears! he hears!" cried Onawandah, and for
the first time Reuben saw tears in his keen eyes, as the
Indian boy turned his face to the sky, full of a gratitude
that no words were sweet enough to tell.</p>

<p>All night Eunice lay peacefully sleeping, and the
moon lighted Onawandah's lonely watch, for Reuben
was worn out with suspense, and slept beside his
sister.</p>

<p>In the morning she was safe, and great was the
rejoicing; but for two days the little invalid was not
allowed to continue the journey, much as they longed
to hurry on. It was a pretty sight, the bed of hemlock
boughs spread under a green tent of woven
branches, and on the pillow of moss the pale child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
watching the flicker of sunshine through the leaves,
listening to the babble of a brook close by, or sleeping
tranquilly, lulled by the murmur of the pines. Patient,
loving, and grateful, it was a pleasure to serve her,
and both the lads were faithful nurses. Onawandah
cooked birds for her to eat, and made a pleasant drink
of the wild-raspberry leaves to quench her thirst.
Reuben snared rabbits, that she might have nourishing
food, and longed to shoot a deer for provision, that
she might not suffer hunger again on their journey.
This boyish desire led him deeper into the wood than
it was wise for him to go alone, for it was near nightfall,
and wild creatures haunted the forest in those
days. The fire, which Onawandah kept constantly
burning, guarded their little camp where Eunice lay;
but Reuben, with no weapon but his bow and hunting
knife, was beyond this protection when he at last gave
up his vain hunt and turned homeward. Suddenly,
the sound of stealthy steps startled him, but he could
see nothing through the dusk at first, and hurried on,
fearing that some treacherous Indian was following
him. Then he remembered his sister, and resolved
not to betray her resting-place if he could help it, for
he had learned courage of Onawandah, and longed to
be as brave and generous as his dusky hero.</p>

<p>So he paused to watch and wait, and soon saw the
gleam of two fiery eyes, not behind, but above him, in
a tree. Then he knew that it was an "Indian devil,"
as they called a species of fierce animal that lurked
in the thickets and sprang on its prey like a small
tiger.</p>

<p>"If I could only kill it alone, how proud Onawandah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
would be of me," thought Reuben, burning for the
good opinion of his friend.</p>

<p>It would have been wiser to hurry on and give the
beast no time to spring; but the boy was over bold,
and, fitting an arrow to the string, aimed at the bright
eye-ball and let fly. A sharp snarl showed that some
harm was done, and, rather daunted by the savage
sound, Reuben raced away, meaning to come back
next day for the prize he hoped he had secured.</p>

<p>But soon he heard the creature bounding after him,
and he uttered one ringing shout for help, feeling too
late that he had been foolhardy. Fortunately, he was
nearer camp than he thought. Onawandah heard him,
and was there in time to receive the beast, as, mad
with the pain of the wound, it sprung at Reuben.
There was no time for words, and the boy could
only watch in breathless interest and anxiety the
fight which went on between the brute and the
Indian.</p>

<p>It was sharp but short; for Onawandah had his
knife, and as soon as he could get the snarling, struggling
creature down, he killed it with a skilful stroke.
But not before it had torn and bitten him more dangerously
than he knew; for the dusk hid the wounds,
and excitement kept him from feeling them at first.
Reuben thanked him heartily, and accepted his
few words of warning with grateful docility; then
both hurried back to Eunice, who till next day knew
nothing of her brother's danger.</p>

<p>Onawandah made light of his scratches, as he called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
them, got their supper, and sent Reuben early to bed,
for to-morrow they were to start again.</p>

<p>Excited by his adventure, the boy slept lightly, and
waking in the night, saw by the flicker of the fire Onawandah
binding up a deep wound in his breast with
wet moss and his own belt. A stifled groan betrayed
how much he suffered; but when Reuben went to him,
he would accept no help, said it was nothing, and sent
him back to bed, preferring to endure the pain in
stern silence, with true Indian pride and courage.</p>

<p>Next morning, they set out and pushed on as fast as
Eunice's strength allowed. But it was evident that
Onawandah suffered much, though he would not rest,
forbade the children to speak of his wounds, and
pressed on with feverish haste, as if he feared that his
strength might not hold out. Reuben watched him
anxiously, for there was a look in his face that troubled
the boy and filled him with alarm, as well as with
remorse and love. Eunice would not let him carry
her as before, but trudged bravely behind him, though
her feet ached and her breath often failed as she tried
to keep up; and both children did all they could to
comfort and sustain their friend, who seemed glad to
give his life for them.</p>

<p>In three days they reached the river, and, as if
Heaven helped them in their greatest need, found a
canoe, left by some hunter, near the shore. In they
sprang, and let the swift current bear them along,
Eunice kneeling in the bow like a little figure-head of
Hope, Reuben steering with his paddle, and Onawandah
sitting with arms tightly folded over his breast, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
if to control the sharp anguish of the neglected wound.
He knew that it was past help now, and only cared to
see the children safe; then, worn out but happy, he was
proud to die, having paid his debt to the good parson,
and proved that he was not a liar nor a traitor.</p>

<p>Hour after hour they floated down the great river,
looking eagerly for signs of home, and when at last
they entered the familiar valley, while the little girl
cried for joy, and the boy paddled as he had never
done before, Onawandah sat erect, with his haggard
eyes fixed on the dim distance, and sang his death-song
in a clear, strong voice,&mdash;though every breath
was pain,&mdash;bent on dying like a brave, without complaint
or fear.</p>

<p>At last they saw the smoke from the cabins on the
hillside, and, hastily mooring the canoe, all sprang
out, eager to be at home after their long and perilous
wandering. But as his foot touched the land, Onawandah
felt that he could do no more, and stretching
his arms toward the parsonage, the windows of which
glimmered as hospitably as they had done when he
first saw them, he said, with a pathetic sort of triumph
in his broken voice: "Go. I cannot. Tell the good
father, Onawandah not lie, not forget. He keep his
promise."</p>

<p>Then he dropped upon the grass and lay as if dead,
while Reuben, bidding Eunice keep watch, ran as fast
as his tired legs could carry him to tell the tale and
bring help.</p>

<p>The little girl did her part tenderly, carrying water
in her hands to wet the white lips, tearing up her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
ragged skirt to lay fresh bandages on the wound that
had been bleeding the brave boy's life away, and, sitting
by him, gathered his head into her arms, begging
him to wait till father came.</p>

<p>But poor Onawandah had waited too long; now he
could only look up into the dear, loving, little face
bent over him, and whisper wistfully: "Wild Rose
will remember Onawandah?" as the light went out of
his eyes, and his last breath was a smile for her.</p>

<p>When the parson and his people came hurrying up
full of wonder, joy, and good-will, they found Eunice
weeping bitterly, and the Indian boy lying like a
young warrior smiling at death.</p>

<p>"Ah, my neighbors, the savage has taught us a lesson
we never can forget. Let us imitate his virtues,
and do honor to his memory," said the pastor, as he
held his little daughter close and looked down at the
pathetic figure at his feet, whose silence was more
eloquent than any words.</p>

<p>All felt it, and even old Becky had a remorseful
sigh for the boy who had kept his word so well and
given back her darlings safe.</p>

<p>They buried him where he lay; and for years the
lonely mound under the great oak was kept green by
loving hands. Wild roses bloomed there, and the murmur
of the Long River of Pines was a fit lullaby for
faithful Onawandah.<br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the sort I like," said Geoff, as the story
ended; "Onawandah was a trump, and I'd give a
good deal to know such a fellow, and go hunting with
him. Got any more like it, aunty?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps; but it is the girls' turn now, and here is
a quiet little story that teaches the same lesson in a
different way. It contains a hint which some of you
would better take;" and Aunt Elinor glanced around
the circle with a smile that set her hearers on the
alert to see who was to be hit.</p>

<p>"Hope it isn't <i>very</i> moral," said Geoff, with a boyish
dislike of being preached at.</p>

<p>"It won't harm you to listen, and take the moral to
heart, my lad. Wild horses, gold mines, and sea
scrapes, are not the only things worth reading about.
If you ever do half so much good in the world as the
people in this story did, I shall be proud of you," answered
Aunt Elinor, so soberly that Geoff folded his
hands, and tried to look meekly impressed.</p>

<p>"Is it true?" asked Min.</p>

<p>"Yes. I heard 'Abby' tell it herself, and saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
silk stocking, and the scar."</p>

<p>"That sounds <i>very</i> interesting. I do like to hear
about good clothes and awful accidents," cried the
girl, forgetting to spin, in her eagerness to listen.</p>

<p>They all laughed at her odd mixture of tastes, and
then heard the story of</p>


<h4>LITTLE THINGS.</h4>

<p>Abigail sat reading "Rasselas" aloud to her father
while he shaved, pausing now and then to explain a
word or correct the girl's pronunciation; for this was
a lesson, as well as a pleasure. The handsome man,
in his nankin dressing-gown, ruffled shirt, black small-clothes,
and silk stockings, stood before the tall, old-fashioned
bureau, looking often from the reflection of
his own ruddy face to the pale one beside him, with
an expression of tender pride, which plainly showed
how dear his young daughter was to him.</p>

<p>Abby was a slender girl of fifteen, in a short-waisted
gingham gown, with a muslin tucker, dimity apron,
and morocco shoes on a pair of small feet demurely
crossed before her. A blue-eyed, brown-haired little
creature, with a broad brow, and a sweet mouth, evidently
both intelligent and affectionate; for she
heartily enjoyed the story, and answered her father's
approving glances with a face full of the loving reverence
so beautiful to see.</p>

<p>Schools were not abundant in 1815; and, after
learning to read, spell, sew, and cipher a little at some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
dame school, girls were left to pick up knowledge as
they could; while the brothers went to college, or
were apprenticed to some trade. But the few things
they did study were well learned; so that Abby's
reading was a pleasure to hear. She wrote a fine,
clear hand, seldom misspelled a word, kept her own
little account-book in good order, and already made her
father's shirts, hemstitching the linen cambric ruffles
with the daintiest skill, and turning out button-holes
any one might be proud of. These accomplishments
did not satisfy her, however, and she longed to know
much more,&mdash;to do and be something great and
good,&mdash;with the sincere longing of an earnest,
thoughtful girl.</p>

<p>These morning talks with her father were precious
half-hours to her; for they not only read and discussed
well-chosen books, but Abby opened her
heart freely, and received his wise counsels with a
grateful docility which helped to make her after-life
as benevolent and blessed as his.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder that Rasselas wanted to get out of
the Happy Valley and see the world for himself. I
often feel so, and long to go and have adventures, like
the people I read about; to do something very splendid,
and be brave and great and loved and honored,"
said Abby, as she closed the book, and looked out of
the open window with wistful eyes; for the chestnut
trees were rustling in the May sunshine, and spring
was stirring in the girl's heart, as well as in the
budding boughs and early flowers on the green bank
below.</p>

<p>"Do not be in a hurry to leave your Happy Valley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
my dear; but help to keep it so by doing your part
well. The happiness of life depends very much on little
things; and one can be brave and great and good while
making small sacrifices and doing small duties faithfully
and cheerfully," answered Mr. Lyon, with the
look of one who practised what he preached.</p>

<p>"But <i>my</i> little things are so stupid and easy. Sewing,
and learning to pickle and preserve, and going
out to tea when I don't want to, and helping mother,
are none of them romantic or exciting duties and sacrifices.
If I could take care of poor people, or be a
colonel in a splendid uniform, and march with drums
and trumpets,&mdash;or even a fire-warden, and run to save
lives and property, and be loved and thanked and
trusted, as you are, I should be contented," continued
Abby, kindling at the thought; for she considered
her father the noblest of men, and glowed with
pride when she saw him in his regimentals on great
occasions, or when she helped him into the leathern
cap and coat, and gave him the lantern, staff, and
canvas bags he used, as fire-warden, long before steam-engines,
hook and ladder companies, and electric
alarms were dreamed of.</p>

<p>Mr. Lyon laughed as he washed his face at the
queer, three-cornered stand, and then sat down to
have his hair tied in a queue by his daughter, who
prided herself on doing this as well as a barber.</p>

<p>"Ah, my girl, it's not the things that make the
most noise and show that are the bravest and the
best; but the everlasting patience, charity, and courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
needed to bear our daily trials like good Christians."
And the smile changed to a sigh, for the
excellent man knew the value of these virtues, and
their rarity.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, sir; but it is so splendid to be a
hero, and have the world ring with one's glory, like
Washington and Lafayette, or Perry, Hull, and
Lawrence," said Abby, winding the black ribbon so
energetically that it nearly broke; for her head was
full of the brave deeds performed in the wars of 1775
and 1812, the latter of which she well remembered.</p>

<p>"Easy, my dear, easy!&mdash;remember that it was the
faithful doing of small things which fitted these men
to do the grand deeds well, when the time came. Heroes
are not made in a minute, and we never know
what we may be called upon to live through. Train
yourself now to be skilful, prompt, courageous, and
kind; then when the duty or the danger comes,
you will be prepared for it. 'Keep your spindle
ready, and the Lord will send the flax,' as the old
proverb says."</p>

<p>"I will, father, and remember the other saying that
you like and live up to, 'Do right and leave the consequences
to God,'" answered Abby, with her arm about
his neck, and a soft cheek against his, feeling that with
such an example before her she ought not to fail.</p>

<p>"That's my good girl! Come, now, begin at once.
Here's a little thing to do, a very homely one, but
useful, and some honor may be gained by doing it
nicely; for, if you'll darn this bad rent in my new
stocking, I'll give you five dollars."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Mr. Lyon handed her a heavy silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
stocking with a great "barn-door" tear in the calf.
He was rather proud of his handsome legs, and
dressed them with care, importing hose of unusual fineness
for state occasions; being one of the old-time gentlemen
whose stately elegance added dignity to any
scene.</p>

<p>Abby groaned as she examined the hole torn by a
nail, for it was a very bad one, and she knew that if
not well done, the costly stocking would be ruined.
She hated to darn, infinitely preferring to read, or
study Latin with her brother, instead of repairing old
damask, muslin gowns, and the family hose. But
she did it well, excelling her elder sister in this branch
of needle-work; so she could not refuse, though the
sacrifice of time and taste would have been almost
impossible for any one but father.</p>

<p>"I'll try, sir, and you shall pay me with a kiss;
five dollars is too much for such a little thing," she
said, smiling at him as she put the stocking into the
capacious pocket where girls kept housewife, scissors,
thimble, pin-ball, and a bit of lovage or flag-root in
those days.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure that you'll find it an easy job;
but remember Bruce and his spider, and don't be
conquered by the 'little thing.' Now I must be off.
Good-by, my darling," and Mr. Lyon's dark eyes
twinkled as he thought of the task he had set her;
for it seemed as if nothing short of a miracle could
restore his damaged stocking.</p>

<p>Abby forgot her heroics and ran to get his hat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
cane, to receive his morning kiss, and answer the salute
he always paused at the street corner to give her
before he went away to the many cares and labors of
his own busy day. But while she put her little room
in order, dusted the parlor, and clapped laces for her
mother, who, like most ladies long ago, did up her
own caps and turbans, Abby was thinking over the
late conversation, and wondering if strict attention to
small affairs would really lead to something good or
glorious in the end.</p>

<p>When her other duties were done, she resolutely sat
down to the detested darn, although it would have
been much pleasanter to help her sister cut out green
satin leaves and quill up pink ribbon into roses for a
garland to festoon the skirt of a new white dress.</p>

<p>Hour after hour she worked, slowly and carefully
weaving the torn edges together, stitch by stitch, till
her eyes ached and the delicate needle grew rusty in
her warm hand. Her mother begged her to stop and
rest, sister Catharine called her to come and see how
well the garland looked, and a friend came to take her
to drive. But she refused to stir, and kept at her
weaving, as patiently as King Robert's spider, picking
out a bit that puckered, turning the corner with breathless
care, and rapping it with her thimble on the
wooden egg till it lay flat. Then she waited till an
iron was heated, and pressed it nicely, finishing in time
to put it on her father's bureau, where he would see it
when he dressed for dinner.</p>

<p>"Nearly four hours over that dreadful darn! But
it's done now, and hardly shows, so I do think I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
earned my money. I shall buy that work-box I have
wanted so long. The inlaid one, with nice velvet beds
for the thimble, scissors, and bodkin, and a glass in
the cover, and a little drawer for my silk-reels. Father
will like that, and I shall be proud to show it."</p>

<p>These agreeable thoughts were passing through Abby's
mind as she went into the front yard for a breath
of air, after her long task was over. Tulips and hyacinths
were blooming there, and, peeping through the
bars of the gate, stood a little girl wistfully watching
the gay blossoms and enjoying their perfume. Now,
Abby was fond of her garden, and had been hurrying
the early flowers, that they might be ready for her
father's birthday nosegay; so her first impulse was to
feign that she did not see the child, for she did not
want to give away a single tulip. But the morning
talk was fresh in her memory, and presently she
thought:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here is a little thing I can do;" and ashamed of
the selfish impulse, she gathered several of her finest
flowers and offered them, saying cordially:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think you would like these. Please take them,
and by and by when there are more, you shall have
prettier ones."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you! I did want some for mamma.
She is ill, and will be so pleased," was the grateful
answer, given with a little courtesy, and a smile that
made the wistful face a very happy one.</p>

<p>"Do you live near by?" asked Abby, seeing at once
from the child's speech and manner that she was both
well-bred and grateful.</p>

<p>"Just around the corner. We are English, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
papa is dead. Mamma kept school in another place
till she was too ill, and now I take care of her and the
children as well as I can."</p>

<p>The little girl of twelve, in her black frock, with a
face far too old and anxious for her years, was so innocently
pathetic as she told the sad story, that Abby's
tender heart was touched, and an impetuous desire to
do something at once made her exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, and I'll send something better
than flowers. Wouldn't your mother like some wine
jelly? I helped make it, and have a glassful all my
own."</p>

<p>"Indeed she would!" began the child, blushing
with pleasure; for the poor lady needed just such
delicacies, but thought only of the children's wants.</p>

<p>Waiting to hear no more, Abby ran in to get her
offering, and came back beaming with benevolent
good-will.</p>

<p>"As it is not far and you have that big basket, I'll
go with you and help carry the things, if I may? My
mother will let me, and my father will come and see
you, I'm sure, if you'd like to have him. He takes
care of everybody, and is the best and wisest man in
all the world."</p>

<p>Lucy Mayhew accepted these kind offers with childish
confidence, thinking the young lady a sort of angel
in a coal-scuttle bonnet, and the two went chatting
along, good friends at once; for Abby had most engaging
manners, and her cheerful face won its way everywhere.</p>

<p>She found the English family a very interesting one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
for the mother was a gentlewoman, and in sore straits
now,&mdash;being unable to use her accomplishments any
longer, and failing fast, with no friends to protect the
four little children she must soon leave alone in a
strange land.</p>

<p>"If <i>they</i> were only cared for, I could go in peace;
but it breaks my heart to think of them in an asylum,
when they need a home," said the poor lady,
telling her greatest anxiety to this sympathetic young
visitor; while Lucy regaled the noses of the eager
little ones with delicious sniffs of the pink and blue
hyacinths.</p>

<p>"Tell father all about it, and he'll know just what
to do. He always does, and every one goes to him.
May he come and see you, ma'am?" said Abby, longing
to take them all home at once.</p>

<p>"He will be as welcome as an angel from Heaven,
my child. I am failing very fast, and help and comfort
are sorely needed," answered the grateful woman,
with wet eyes and a heart too full for many thanks.</p>

<p>Abby's eyes were full also, and promising to "send
father soon," she went away, little dreaming that the
handful of flowers and a few kind words were the
first links in a chain of events that brought a blessing
into her own home.</p>

<p>She waited anxiously for her father's return, and
blushed with pleasure as he said, after examining her
morning's work:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wonderfully well done, my dear! Your mother
says she couldn't have done it better herself."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry that it shows at all; but it was impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to hide that corner, and if you wear it on the
inside of the leg, it won't be seen much," explained
Abby, anxiously.</p>

<p>"It shows just enough for me to know where to
point when I boast of my girl's patience and skill.
People say I'm making a blue-stocking of you, because
we read Johnson; but my black stocking will prove
that I haven't spoiled you yet," said Mr. Lyon, pinching
her cheek, as they went down to dinner arm in
arm.</p>

<p>Literary ladies were looked upon with awe, and by
many with disapproval, in those days; so Abby's studious
tastes were criticised by the good cousins and
aunts, who feared she might do something peculiar;
though, years later, they were very proud of the fine
letters she wrote, and the intellectual society which she
had unconsciously fitted herself to enjoy and adorn.</p>

<p>Abby laughed at her father's joke, but said no more
just then; for young people sat silent at table while
their elders talked. She longed to tell about Lucy;
and when dessert came, she drew her chair near to her
father's, that she might pick the kernels from his walnuts
and drop them into his wine, waiting till he said,
as usual: "Now, little girl, let's take comfort." For
both enjoyed the hour of rest he allowed himself in the
middle of the day.</p>

<p>On this occasion he varied the remark by adding,
as he took a bill from his pocket-book and gave it to
her with a kiss: "Well-earned money, my dear, and
most cheerfully paid."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir! It seems a great deal for such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
small job. But I <i>do</i> want it very much. May I tell
you how I'd like to spend it, father?" cried Abby,
beaming with the sweet delight of helping others.</p>

<p>"Yes, child; come and tell me. Something for
sister, I suspect; or a new book, perhaps." And, drawing
her to his knee, Mr. Lyon waited with a face full
of benignant interest in her little confidences.</p>

<p>She told her story eagerly and well, exclaiming as
she ended: "And now, I'm so glad, so very glad, I
have this money, all my own, to spend for those dear
little things! I know you'll help them; but it's so
nice to be able to do my part, and giving away is such
a pleasure."</p>

<p>"You are your father's own daughter in that, child.
I must go and get my contribution ready, or I shall be
left out," said Mrs. Lyon, hastening away to add one
more charity to the many which made her quiet life so
beautiful.</p>

<p>"I will go and see our neighbor this evening, and
you shall come with me. You see, my girl, that the
homely 'little job' is likely to be a large and pleasant
one, and you have earned your part in it. Do
the duty that comes first, and one never knows
what beautiful experience it may blossom into. Use
your earnings as you like, and God bless you, my
dear."</p>

<p>So Abby had her part in the happy days that came
to the Mayhews, and enjoyed it more than a dozen
work-boxes; while her father was never tired of showing
the handsome darn and telling the story of it.</p>

<p>Help and comfort were much needed around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
corner; for very soon the poor lady died. But her
confidence in the new friends raised up to her was not
misplaced; and when all was over, and people asked,
"What will become of the children?" Mr. Lyon
answered the sad question by leading the four little
orphans to his own house, and keeping them till good
homes were found for the three youngest.</p>

<p>Lucy was heart-broken, and clung to Abby in her
sorrow, as if nothing else could console her for all she
had lost. No one had the heart to speak of sending
her away at present; and, before long, the grateful
little creature had won a place for herself which she
never forfeited.</p>

<p>It was good for Abby to have a care of this sort, and
her generous nature enjoyed it thoroughly, as she
played elder sister in the sweetest way. It was her
first real lesson in the charity that made her after-life
so rich and beautiful; but then she little dreamed how
well she was to be repaid for her small share in the
good work which proved to be a blessing to them all.</p>

<p>Soon, preparations for sister Catharine's wedding
produced a pleasant bustle in the house, and both the
younger girls were as busy as bees, helping everywhere.
Dressmakers ripped and stitched upstairs, visitors gossiped
in the parlor, and cooks simmered and scolded in
the kitchen; while notable Madam Lyon presided over
the household, keeping the peace and gently bringing
order out of chaos.</p>

<p>Abby had a new sprigged muslin frock, with a white
sash, and her first pair of silk stockings, a present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
from her father. A bunch of pink roses gave the
finishing touch, and she turned up her hair with a tortoise-shell
comb in honor of the occasion.</p>

<p>All the relations&mdash;and there were many of them&mdash;came
to the wedding, and the hospitable mansion was
crowded with old and young. A fine breakfast was
prepared, a line of carriages filled the quiet street, and
troops of stately ladies and gentlemen came marching
in; for the Lyons were a much-honored family.</p>

<p>The interesting moment arrived at last, the minister
opened his book, the lovely bride entered with her
groom, and a solemn silence fell upon the rustling
crowd. Abby was much excited, and felt that she
was about to disgrace herself by crying. Fortunately
she stood near the door, and finding that a sob <i>would</i>
come at thought of her dear sister going away forever,
she slipped out and ran upstairs to hide her tears in
the back bedroom, where she was put to accommodate
guests.</p>

<p>As she opened the door, a puff of smoke made her
catch her breath, then run to throw open the window
before she turned to look for the fallen brand. A fire
had been kindled in this room a short time before, and,
to Abby's dismay, the sudden draught fanned the
smouldering sparks which had crept from a fallen log
to the mop-board and thence around the wooden
mantel-piece. A suspicious crackling was heard, little
tongues of flame darted from the cracks, and the air
was full of smoke.</p>

<p>Abby's first impulse was to fly downstairs, screaming
"Fire!" at the top of her voice; her second was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to stand still and think what to do,&mdash;for an instant's
recollection showed her what terror and confusion such
a cry would produce in the crowded house, and how
unseemly a panic would be at such a time.</p>

<p>"If I could only get at father! But I can't without
scaring every one. What would he do? I've heard
him tell about fires, and how to put them out; I know,&mdash;stop
the draught first," and Abby shut the window.
"Now water and wet blankets," and away she ran to
the bath-room, and filling a pail, dashed the water over
the burning wood. Then, pulling the blankets from off
the bed, she wet them as well as she could, and hung
them up before the fire-place, going to and fro for more
water till the smoke ceased to pour out and the crackling
stopped.</p>

<p>These energetic measures were taken just in time to
prevent a serious fire, and when Abby dared to rest a
moment, with her eyes on the chimney, fearing the
treacherous blaze might burst out in a new place,
she discovered that her clothes were wet, her face
blackened, her hands blistered, and her breath
gone.</p>

<p>"No matter," she thought, still too much elated
with her success to feel the pain. "Father will be
pleased, I know; for this is what he would call an
emergency, and I've had my wits about me. I wish
mother would come. Oh, dear! how queerly I feel&mdash;"
and in the midst of her self-congratulation, poor little
Abby fainted away,&mdash;slipping to the floor and lying
there, like a new sort of Casabianca, faithful at her
post.</p>

<p>Lucy found her very soon, having missed her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
come to look for her the minute the service was over.
Much frightened, she ran down again and tried to tell
Mr. and Mrs. Lyon quietly. But her pale face alarmed
every one, and when Abby came to herself, she was
in her father's arms, being carried from the scene of
devastation to her mother's room, where a crowd of
anxious relatives received her like a conquering
hero.</p>

<p>"Well done, my brave little fire-warden! I'm proud
of you!" were the first words she heard; and they were
more reviving than the burnt feathers under her nose,
or the lavender-water plentifully sprinkled over her by
her mother and sister.</p>

<p>With that hearty commendation, her father left her,
to see that all was safe, and Abby found that another
sort of courage was needed to support her through
the next half-hour of trial; for her hands were badly
burned, and each of the excellent relatives suggested
a different remedy.</p>

<p>"Flour them!" cried Aunt Sally, fanning her violently.</p>

<p>"Goose-oil and cotton-batting," suggested Aunt
Patty.</p>

<p>"Nothing so good as lard," pronounced Aunt Nabby.</p>

<p>"I always use dry starch or a piece of salt pork,"
added cousin Lucretia.</p>

<p>"Butter them!" commanded grandma. "That's
what I did when my Joseph fell into the boiler and
came out with his blessed little legs the color of lobsters.
Butter them, Dolly."</p>

<p>That settled the vexed question, and Abby's hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
were well buttered, while a hearty laugh composed the
spirits of the agitated party; for the contrast between
grandma's words and her splendid appearance, as she
sat erect in the big arm-chair issuing commands like a
general, in silver-gray satin and an imposing turban,
was very funny.</p>

<p>Then Abby was left to repose, with Lucy and old
Nurse beside her, while the rest went down to eat the
wedding feast and see the happy pair off in a chaise,
with the portmanteau slung underneath, on their quiet
honey-moon trip to Pomfret.</p>

<p>When the bustle was all over, Abby found herself a
heroine in her small circle of admiring friends and
neighbors, who praised and petted her as if she had
saved the city from destruction. She needed comfort
very much; for one hand was so seriously injured that
it never entirely recovered from the deep burn, which
contracted two of her finger-tips. This was a great
sorrow to the poor girl; for she could no longer play
on her piano, and was forced to content herself with
singing like a lark when all joined in the sweet old
ballads forgotten now.</p>

<p>It was a misfortune, but it had its happy side;
for, during the long months when she was partially
helpless, books were her solace, and she studied
many things which other duties or pleasures would
have crowded out, if "Abby's poor hand" had not
been an excuse for such liberty and indulgence. It
did not make her selfish, however, for while regretting
her uselessness, she unexpectedly found work to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
do that made her own life happy by cheering that of
another.</p>

<p>Lucy proved to be a most intelligent child; and
when Abby asked what return she could make for all
the little girl's loving service during her trouble, she
discovered that help about lessons would be the favor
most desired. Lucy's too early cares had kept her
from learning much, and now that she had leisure,
weak eyes forbade study, and she longed vainly to get
on as her new friend did; for Abby was her model in
all things,&mdash;looked up to with admiration, love, and
wonder.</p>

<p>"Father, I've been thinking that I might read
Lucy's lessons to her and hear her recite. Then she
wouldn't grieve about being backward, and I can be
eyes to her as she is hands to me. I can't sew or work
now, but I can teach the little I know. May I, sir?"
asked Abby, one morning, after reading a paper in the
<i>Spectator</i>, and having a pleasant talk about it during
the happy half-hour.</p>

<p>"A capital plan, daughter, if you are sure you can
keep on. To begin and then fail would leave the child
worse off for the hope and disappointment. It will be
tiresome to go on day after day, so think well before
you propose it," answered her father, much pleased
with the idea.</p>

<p>"I <i>can</i> do it, and I <i>will</i>! If I get tired, I'll look
at you and mother,&mdash;always so faithful to what you
undertake,&mdash;and remember my motto," cried Abby,
anxious to follow the example set her in the daily life
of these good parents.</p>

<p>A hearty hand-shake rewarded her, and she set about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the new task with a resolute purpose to succeed. It
was hard at first to go back to her early lessons and
read them over and over again to eager Lucy, who did
her best to understand, remember, and recite. But
good-will and gratitude worked wonders; and day
after day, week after week, month after month, the
teaching went on, to the great surprise and satisfaction
of those who watched this labor of love. Both learned
much, and a very strong, sweet friendship grew up,
which lasted till the young girls became old women.</p>

<p>For nearly two years the daily lessons were continued;
then Lucy was ready and able to go to school,
and Abby free from the duty that had grown a
pleasure. Sister Catherine being gone, she was the
young lady of the house now, and began to go to a
few parties, where she distinguished herself by her
graceful dancing, and sprightly though modest manners.
She had grown strong and rosy with the exercise
her sensible mother prescribed and her energetic
father encouraged, taking long walks with her to Roxbury
and Dorchester on holidays, over bridges and
around the common before breakfast each morning,
till the pale little girl was a tall and blooming creature,
full of life and spirit,&mdash;not exactly beautiful, but with
a sweet, intelligent face, and the frank, cordial ways
that are so charming. Her brother Sam was very
proud of her, and liked to see her surrounded by his
friends at the merry-makings to which he escorted
her; for she talked as well as she danced, and the
older gentlemen enjoyed a good chat with Miss Abby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
as much as the younger ones did the elaborate pigeon-wings
and pirouettes then in vogue.</p>

<p>Among the older men was one whom Abby much
admired; for he had fought, travelled, and studied
more than most men of his age, and earned the honors
he wore so modestly. She was never tired of asking
him questions when they met, and he never seemed
tired of giving long, interesting replies; so they often
sat and talked while others danced, and Abby never
guessed that he was studying her bright face and innocent
heart as eagerly as she listened to his agreeable
conversation and stirring adventures.</p>

<p>Presently he came to the house with brother Sam,
who shared Abby's regard for him; and there, while
the young men amused themselves, or paid their respects
to the elders, one of them was still watching
the tall girl with the crown of brown hair, as she sat
by her father, poured the tea for Madam, laughed with
her brother, or made bashful Lucy share their pleasures;
always so busy, dutiful, and winning, that the
visitor pronounced Mr. Lyon's the most delightful
house in Boston. He heard all the little tales of
Abby's youth from Sam, and Lucy added her tribute
with the eloquence of a grateful heart; he saw how
loved and trusted she was, and he soon longed to
know how she would answer the question he desired
to ask her. Having received permission from Papa,
in the decorous old style, he only waited for an
opportunity to discover if charming Abigail would
consent to change her name from Lyon to Lamb;
and, as if her lesson was to be quite complete, a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
thing decided her fate and made a very happy woman
of the good girl.</p>

<p>On Abby's seventeenth birthday, there was to be a
party in her honor, at the hospitable family mansion,
to which all her friends were invited; and, when she
came down early to see that all was in order, she
found one impatient guest had already arrived.</p>

<p>It was not alone the consciousness that the new
pink taffeta gown and the wreath of white roses
were very becoming which made her blush so prettily
as she thanked her friend for the fine nosegay he
brought her, but something in his face, though he
only wished her many happy returns in a hearty way,
and then added, laughing, as the last button flew off
the glove he was awkwardly trying to fasten,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is evident that you didn't sew on these buttons,
Miss Abby. I've observed that Sam's never
come off, and he says you always keep them in
order."</p>

<p>"Let me put one on for you. It will take but a
moment, and you'll be so uncomfortable without
it," said Abby, glad to find employment for her
eyes.</p>

<p>A minute afterward she was sorry she had offered;
for he accepted the little service with thanks, and
stood watching while she sat down at her work-table
and began to sew. She was very sensitive about her
hand, yet ashamed of being so; for the scar was
inside and the drawn fingers showed very little, as it
is natural to half close them. She hoped he had
never seen it, and tried to hide it as she worked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
But this, or some new consciousness, made her usually
nimble fingers lose their skill, and she knotted the
silk, split the button, and dropped her thimble,
growing angry with herself for being so silly and
getting so red and flurried.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm giving you a deal of trouble,"
said the gentleman, who was watching the white
hand with great interest.</p>

<p>"No; it is I who am foolish about my burnt
hands," answered Abby, in her frank, impetuous way.
"See how ugly it is!" And she held it out, as if to
punish herself for the girlish feeling she despised.</p>

<p>The answer to this little outburst made her forget
everything but the sweetest pleasure and surprise;
for, kissing the scarred palm with tender respect,
her lover said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To me it is the finest and the dearest hand in
the world. I know the brave story, and I've seen
the good this generous hand is never tired of doing.
I want it for my own. Will you give it to me,
dear?"</p>

<p>Abby must have answered, "Yes;" for she wore a
new ring under her glove that night, and danced
as if there were wings on the heels of her pink
shoes.</p>

<p>Whether the button ever got sewed on or not, no
one knows; but that bit of needlework was even more
successful than the other small job; for in due time
there was a second wedding, without a fire, and Abby
went away to a happy home of her own, leaving
sister Lucy to fill her place and be the most loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and faithful of daughters to her benefactors while
they lived.</p>

<p>Long years afterward, when she had children and
grandchildren about her, listening to the true old
stories that are the best, Abby used to say, with her
own cheerful laugh:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My father and mother taught me many useful
lessons, but none more valuable than those I learned
that year; and I may honestly say that patience,
perseverance, courage, friendship, and love, came out
of that silk stocking. So let me give you this bit of
advice: Don't despise little things, my dears!"</p>

<p>Larks were singing in the clear
sky over Dinan, the hill-sides were
white with hosts of blooming cherry-trees,
and the valley golden with willow
blossoms. The gray tower of the
good Duchess Anne was hung with
garlands of ivy and gay with tufts of
fragrant wallflowers, and along the
fosse the shadows deepened daily as
the young leaves thickened on the
interlacing branches overhead. Women sang while
they beat their clothes by the pool; wooden shoes
clattered to and fro as the girls brought water from
the fountain in Place St. Louis; men, with their
long hair, embroidered jackets, and baggy breeches,
drank cider at the inn doors; and the great Breton
horses shook their high collars till the bells rang
again, as they passed along the roads that wound
between wide fields of colza, buckwheat, and clover.</p>

<p>Up at the chateau, which stood near the ruins of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the ancient castle, the great banner streamed in the
wind, showing, as its folds blew out, the device and
motto of the Beaumanoir&mdash;two clasped hands and
the legend, "<i>En tout chemin loyaut</i>."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> In the courtyard,
hounds brayed, horses pranced, and servants
hurried about; for the count was going to hunt the
wild boar. Presently, away they went, with the merry
music of horns, the clatter of hoofs, and the blithe
ring of voices, till the pleasant clamor died away in
the distant woods, where mistletoe clung to the great
oaks, and menhirs and dolmens, mysterious relics of
the Druids, were to be seen.</p>

<p>From one of the windows of the chateau-tower a
boy's face looked out, full of eager longing,&mdash;a fine,
strong face, but sullen now, with black brows, dark,
restless eyes, and lips set, as if rebellious thoughts were
stirring in his mind. He watched the gay cavalcade
disappear, until a sunny silence settled over the landscape,
broken only by the larks and the sound of a
girl's voice singing. As he listened, the frown smoothed
itself from his brow, and his eye brightened when it
rested on a blue-gowned, white-capped figure, sprinkling
webs of linen, spread to bleach in the green
meadow by the river Rance.</p>

<p>"If I may not hunt, I'll away to Yvonne<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2">
    </a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B] </a>and take
a holiday. She can tell better tales than any in this
weary book, the bane of my life!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, the boy struck a volume that lay
on the wide ledge, with a petulant energy that sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
it fluttering down into the court-yard below. Half-ashamed
and half-amused, young Gaston peeped to see
if this random shot had hit any one. But all was quiet
and deserted now; so, with a boyish laugh and a daring
glance at the dangerous descent, he said to the doves
cooing on the roof overhead: "Here's a fine pretext
for escape. Being locked in, how can I get my lesson
unless I fetch the book? Tell no tales of the time I
linger, and you shall be well fed, my pretty birds."</p>

<p>Then swinging himself out as if it were no new feat,
he climbed boldly down through the ivy that half hid
the carved flowers and figures which made a ladder for
his agile feet.</p>

<p>The moment he touched ground, he raced away like
a hound in full scent to the meadow, where he was
welcomed by a rosy, brown-eyed lass, whose white
teeth shone as she laughed to see him leap the moat,
dodge behind the wall, and come bounding toward her,
his hair streaming in the wind, and his face full of
boyish satisfaction in this escapade.</p>

<p>"The old tale," he panted, as he threw himself
down upon the grass and flung the recovered book
beside him. "This dreary Latin drives me mad, and
I will <i>not</i> waste such days as this poring over dull
pages like a priest, when I should be hunting like a
knight and gentleman."</p>

<p>"Nay, dear Gaston, but you ought, for obedience
is the first duty of the knight, and honor of the
gentleman," answered the girl, in a soft, reproachful
tone, which seemed to touch the lad, as the voice of a
master tames a high-mettled horse.</p>

<p>"Had Father Nevin trusted to my honor, I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
not have run away; but he locked me in, like a monk
in a cell, and that I will not bear. Just one hour,
Yvonne, one little hour of freedom, then I will go
back, else there will be no sport for me to-morrow,"
said the lad, recklessly pulling up the bluets that
starred the grass about him.</p>

<p>"Ah, if I were set to such a task, I would so gladly
learn it, that I might be a fitter friend for you," said
the girl, reverently turning the pages of the book she
could not read.</p>

<p>"No need of that; I like you as you are, and by
my faith, I doubt your great willingness, for when I
last played tutor and left you to spell out the pretty
legend of St. Coventin and his little fish, I found you
fast asleep with the blessed book upon the floor,"
laughed Gaston, turning the tables on his mentor,
with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>The girl laughed also as she retorted, "My tutor
should not have left me to play with his dogs. I bore
my penance better than you, and did not run away.
Come now, we'll be merry. Will you talk, or shall
I sing, while you rest this hot head, and dream of
horse and hound and spearing the wild boar?" added
Yvonne, smoothing the locks of hair scattered on the
grass, with a touch as gentle as if the hand were that
of a lady, and not that of a peasant, rough with hard
work.</p>

<p>"Since I may not play a man's part yet, amuse me
like a boy, with the old tales your mother used to tell,
when we watched the fagots blaze in the winter nights.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
It is long since I have heard one, and I am never tired
hearing of the deeds I mean to match, if not outdo,
some day.</p>

<p>"Let me think a bit till I remember your favorites,
and do you listen to the bees above there in the
willow, setting you a good example, idle boy," said
Yvonne, spreading a coarse apron for his head, while
she sat beside him racking her brain for tales to beguile
this truant hour.</p>

<p>Her father was the count's forester, and when the
countess had died some sixteen years before, leaving
a month-old boy, good dame Gillian had taken the
motherless baby, and nursed and reared him with her
little girl, so faithfully and tenderly that the count
never could forget the loyal service. As babies, the
two slept in one cradle; as children they played and
quarrelled together; and as boy and girl they defended,
comforted, and amused each other. But time brought
inevitable changes, and both felt that the hour of
separation was near; for, while Yvonne went on leading
the peasant life to which she was born, Gaston
was receiving the education befitting a young count.
The chaplain taught him to read and write, with
lessons in sacred history, and a little Latin; of the
forester he learned woodcraft; and his father taught
him horsemanship and the use of arms, accomplishments
considered all-important in those days.</p>

<p>Gaston cared nothing for books, except such as told
tales of chivalry; but dearly loved athletic sports, and
at sixteen rode the most fiery horse without a fall,
handled a sword admirably, could kill a boar at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
first shot, and longed ardently for war, that he might
prove himself a man. A brave, high-spirited, generous
boy, with a very tender spot in his heart for the good
woman who had been a mother to him, and his little
foster-sister, whose idol he was. For days he seemed
to forget these humble friends, and led the gay, active
life of his age and rank; but if wounded in the chase,
worried by the chaplain, disappointed in any plan, or
in disgrace for any prank, he turned instinctively to
Dame Gillian and Yvonne, sure of help and comfort
for mind and body.</p>

<p>Companionship with him had refined the girl, and
given her glimpses of a world into which she could
never enter, yet where she could follow with eager
eyes and high hopes the fortunes of this dear Gaston,
who was both her prince and brother. Her influence
over him was great, for she was of a calm and patient
nature, as well as brave and prudent beyond her
years. His will was law; yet in seeming to obey,
she often led him, and he thanked her for the courage
with which she helped him to control his fiery temper
and strong will. Now, as she glanced at him she saw
that he was already growing more tranquil, under
the soothing influences of the murmuring river, the
soft flicker of the sunshine, and a blessed sense of
freedom.</p>

<p>So, while she twisted her distaff, she told the stirring
tales of warriors, saints, and fairies, whom all
Breton peasants honor, love, and fear. But best of all
was the tale of Gaston's own ancestor, Jean de Beaumanoir,
"the hero of Plormel, where, when sorely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
wounded and parched with thirst, he cried for water,
and Geoffrey du Bois answered, like a grim old warrior
as he was, 'Drink thy blood, Beaumanoir, and the
thirst will pass;' and he drank, and the battle madness
seized him, and he slew ten men, winning the
fight against great odds, to his everlasting glory."</p>

<p>"Ah, those were the times to live in! If they could
only come again, I would be a second Jean!"</p>

<p>Gaston sprung to his feet as he spoke, all aglow with
the warlike ardor of his race, and Yvonne looked up at
him, sure that he would prove himself a worthy descendant
of the great baron and his wife, the daughter
of the brave Du Guesclin.</p>

<p>"But you shall not be treacherously killed, as he
was; for I will save you, as the peasant woman saved
poor Giles de Bretagne when starving in the tower,
or fight for you, as Jeanne d'Arc fought for her lord,"
answered Yvonne, dropping her distaff to stretch out
her hand to him; for she, too, was on her feet.</p>

<p>Gaston took the faithful hand, and pointing to the
white banner floating over the ruins of the old castle,
said heartily: "We will always stand by one another,
and be true to the motto of our house till death."</p>

<p>"We will!" answered the girl, and both kept the
promise loyally, as we shall see.</p>

<p>Just at that moment the sound of hoofs made the
young enthusiasts start and look toward the road that
wound through the valley to the hill. An old man
on a slowly pacing mule was all they saw, but the
change that came over both was comical in its suddenness;
for the gallant knight turned to a truant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
school-boy, daunted by the sight of his tutor, while
the rival of the Maid of Orleans grew pale with
dismay.</p>

<p>"I am lost if he spy me, for my father vowed I
should not hunt again unless I did my task. He will
see me if I run, and where can I hide till he has past?"
whispered Gaston, ashamed of his panic, yet unwilling
to pay the penalty of his prank.</p>

<p>But quick-witted Yvonne saved him; for lifting one
end of the long web of linen, she showed a hollow
whence some great stone had been removed, and
Gaston slipped into the green nest, over which the
linen lay smoothly when replaced.</p>

<p>On came the chaplain, glancing sharply about him,
being of an austere and suspicious nature. He saw
nothing, however, but the peasant girl in her quaint
cap and wooden sabots, singing to herself as she leaned
against a tree, with her earthen jug in her hand. The
mule paused in the light shadow of the willows, to crop
a mouthful of grass before climbing the hill, and the
chaplain seemed glad to rest a moment, for the day
was warm and the road dusty.</p>

<p>"Come hither, child, and give me a draught of
water," he called, and the girl ran to fill her pitcher,
offering it with a low reverence.</p>

<p>"Thanks, daughter! A fine day for the bleaching,
but over warm for much travel. Go to your work,
child; I will tarry a moment in the shade before I
return to my hard task of sharpening a dull youth's
wit," said the old man when he had drunk; and with
a frowning glance at the room where he had left his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
prisoner, he drew a breviary from his pocket and began
to read, while the mule browsed along the road-side.</p>

<p>Yvonne went to sprinkling the neglected linen,
wondering with mingled anxiety and girlish merriment
how Gaston fared. The sun shone hotly on the dry
cloth, and as she approached the boy's hiding-place,
a stir would have betrayed him had the chaplain's
eyes been lifted.</p>

<p>"Sprinkle me quickly; I am stifling in this hole,"
whispered an imploring voice.</p>

<p>"Drink thy blood, Beaumanoir, and the thirst will
pass," quoted Yvonne, taking a naughty satisfaction
in the ignominious captivity of the wilful boy. A long
sigh was the only answer he gave, and taking pity on
him, she made a little hollow in the linen where she
knew his head lay, and poured in water till a choking
sound assured her Gaston had enough. The chaplain
looked up, but the girl coughed loudly, as she went to
refill her jug, with such a demure face that he suspected
nothing, and presently ambled away to seek
his refractory pupil.</p>

<p>The moment he disappeared, a small earthquake
seemed to take place under the linen, for it flew up
violently, and a pair of long legs waved joyfully in the
air as Gaston burst into a ringing laugh, which
Yvonne echoed heartily. Then, springing up, he said,
throwing back his wet hair and shaking his finger
at her: "You dared not betray me, but you nearly
drowned me, wicked girl. I cannot stop for vengeance
now; but I'll toss you into the river some
day, and leave you to get out as you can."</p>

<p>Then he was off as quickly as he came, eager to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
reach his prison again before the chaplain came to
hear the unlearned lesson. Yvonne watched him till
he climbed safely in at the high window and disappeared
with a wave of the hand, when she, too, went
back to her work, little dreaming what brave parts
both were to play in dangers and captivities of which
these youthful pranks and perils were but a foreshadowing.</p>

<p>Two years later, in the month of March, 1793, the
insurrection broke out in Vende, and Gaston had his
wish; for the old count had been an officer of the
king's household, and hastened to prove his loyalty.
Yvonne's heart beat high with pride as she saw her
foster-brother ride gallantly away beside his father,
with a hundred armed vassals behind them, and the
white banner fluttering above their heads in the fresh
wind.</p>

<p>She longed to go with him; but her part was to
watch and wait, to hope and pray, till the hour came
when she, like many another woman in those days,
could prove herself as brave as a man, and freely
risk her life for those she loved.</p>

<p>Four months later the heavy tidings reached them
that the old count was killed and Gaston taken prisoner.
Great was the lamentation among the old
men, women, and children left behind; but they had
little time for sorrow, for a band of the marauding
Vendeans burned the chateau, and laid waste the
Abbey.</p>

<p>"Now, mother, I must up and away to find and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
rescue Gaston. I promised, and if he lives, it shall
be done. Let me go; you are safe now, and there is
no rest for me till I know how he fares," said Yvonne,
when the raid was over, and the frightened peasants
ventured to return from the neighboring forests,
whither they had hastily fled for protection.</p>

<p>"Go, my girl, and bring me news of our young
lord. May you lead him safely home again to rule
over us," answered Dame Gillian, devoted still,&mdash;for
her husband was reported dead with his master, yet
she let her daughter go without a murmur, feeling
that no sacrifice was too great.</p>

<p>So Yvonne set out, taking with her Gaston's pet
dove and the little sum of money carefully hoarded
for her marriage portion. The pretty winged creature,
frightened by the destruction of its home, had
flown to her for refuge, and she had cherished it for
its master's sake. Now, when it would not leave her,
but came circling around her head a league away
from Dinan, she accepted the good omen, and made
the bird the companion of her perilous journey.</p>

<p>There is no room to tell all the dangers, disappointments,
and fatigues endured before she found Gaston;
but after being often misled by false rumors, she at
last discovered that he was a prisoner in Fort Penthivre.
His own reckless courage had brought him
there; for in one of the many skirmishes in which he
had taken part, he ventured too far away from his
men, and was captured after fighting desperately to
cut his way out. Now, alone in his cell, he raged
like a caged eagle, feeling that there was no hope of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
escape; for the fort stood on a plateau of precipitous
rock washed on two sides by the sea. He had heard
of the massacre of the royalist emigrants who landed
there, and tried to prepare himself for a like fate,
hoping to die as bravely as young Sombreuil, who
was shot with twenty others on what was afterward
named the "<i>Champ des Martyrs.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3">
    </a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> His last words,
when ordered by the executioner to kneel, were, "I
do it; but one knee I bend for my God, the other for
my king."</p>

<p>Day after day Gaston looked down from his narrow
window, past which the gulls flew screaming, and
watched the fishers at their work, the women gathering
sea-weed on the shore, and the white sails
flitting across the bay of Quiberon. Bitterly did he
regret the wilfulness which brought him there, well
knowing that if he had obeyed orders he would now
be free to find his father's body and avenge his
death.</p>

<p>"Oh, for one day of liberty, one hope of escape,
one friend to cheer this dreadful solitude!" he cried,
when weeks had passed and he seemed utterly
forgotten.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he shook the heavy bars with impotent
strength, then bent his head as if to hide even
from himself the few hot tears wrung from him by
captivity and despair.</p>

<p>Standing so, with eyes too dim for seeing, something
brushed against his hair, and a bird lit on the
narrow ledge. He thought it was a gull, and paid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>no heed; but in a moment a soft coo started him,
and looking up, he saw a white dove struggling to
get in.</p>

<p>"Blanchette!" he cried, and the pretty creature
flew to his hand, pecking at his lips in the old caressing
way he knew so well.</p>

<p>"My faithful bird, God bless thee!" exclaimed the
poor lad, holding the dove close against his cheek to
hide the trembling of his lip,&mdash;so touched, so glad
was he to find in his dreary prison even a dumb friend
and comforter.</p>

<p>But Blanchette had her part to play, and presently
fluttered back to the window ledge, cooing
loudly as she pecked at something underneath her
wing.</p>

<p>Then Gaston remembered how he used to send
messages to Yvonne by this carrier-dove, and with
a thrill of joy looked for the token, hardly daring to
hope that any would be found. Yes! there, tied
carefully among the white feathers, was a tiny roll of
paper, with these words rudely written on it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be ready; help will come. Y."</p>

<p>"The brave girl! the loyal heart! I might have
known she would keep her promise, and come to
save me;" and Gaston dropped on his knees in
gratitude.</p>

<p>Blanchette meantime tripped about the cell on
her little rosy feet, ate a few crumbs of the hard
bread, dipped her beak in the jug of water, dressed
her feathers daintily, then flew to the bars and called
him.   He had nothing to send back by this sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
messenger but a lock of hair, and this he tied with
the same thread, in place of the note. Then kissing
the bird he bade it go, watching the silver wings
flash in the sunshine as it flew away, carrying joy
with it and leaving hope behind.</p>

<p>After that the little courier came often unperceived,
carrying letters to and fro; for Yvonne sent
bits of paper, and Gaston wrote his answers with
his blood and a quill from Blanchette's wing. He
thus learned how Yvonne was living in a fisher's hut
on the beach, and working for his rescue as well as
she dared. Every day she might be seen gathering
sea-weed on the rocks or twirling her distaff at the
door of the dilapidated hut, not as a young girl, but
as an old woman; for she had stained her fair skin,
put on ragged clothes, and hidden her fresh face
under the pent-house cap worn by the women of
Quiberon. Her neighbors thought her a poor soul
left desolate by the war, and let her live unmolested.
So she worked on secretly and steadily, playing her
part well, and biding her time till the long hempen
rope was made, the sharp file procured unsuspected,
and a boat ready to receive the fugitives.</p>

<p>Her plan was perilously simple, but the only one
possible; for Gaston was well guarded, and out of
that lofty cell it seemed that no prisoner could escape
without wings. A bird and a woman lent him those
wings, and his daring flight was a nine days' wonder
at the fort. Only a youth accustomed to feats of
agility and strength could have safely made that
dangerous escape along the face of the cliff that rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
straight up from the shore. But Gaston was well
trained, and the boyish pranks that used to bring him
into dire disgrace now helped to save his life.</p>

<p>Thus, when the order came, written in the rude
hand he had taught Yvonne long ago, "Pull up the
thread which Blanchette will bring at midnight.
Watch for a light in the bay. Then come down, and
St. Barbe protect you," he was ready; for the tiny file
of watch-spring, brought by the bird, had secretly done
its work, and several bars were loose. He knew that the
attempt might cost him his life, but was willing to gain
liberty even at that price; for imprisonment seemed
worse than death to his impatient spirit. The jailer
went his last round, the great bell struck the appointed
hour, and Gaston stood at the window,
straining his eyes to catch the first ray of the promised
light, when the soft whir of wings gladdened his
ear, and Blanchette arrived, looking scared and wet
and weary, for rain fell, the wind blew fitfully, and
the poor bird was unused to such wild work as this.
But obedient to its training, it flew to its master;
and no angel could have been more welcome than the
storm-beaten little creature as it nestled in his bosom,
while he untangled the lengths of strong thread wound
about one of its feet.</p>

<p>He knew what to do, and tying a bit of the broken
bar to one end, as a weight, he let it down, praying that
no cruel gust would break or blow it away. In a moment
a quick jerk at the thread bade him pull again.
A cord came up, and when that was firmly secured, a
second jerk was the signal for the last and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
important haul. Up came the stout rope, knotted
here and there to add safety and strength to the
hands and feet that were to climb down that frail
ladder, unless some cruel fate dashed the poor boy
dead upon the rocks below. The rope was made fast
to an iron staple inside, the bars were torn away, and
Gaston crept through the narrow opening to perch on
the ledge without, while Blanchette flew down to tell
Yvonne he was coming.</p>

<p>The moment the distant spark appeared, he bestirred
himself, set his teeth, and boldly began the
dangerous descent. Rain blinded him, the wind beat
him against the rock, bruising hands and knees, and
the way seemed endless, as he climbed slowly down,
clinging with the clutch of a drowning man, and
blessing Yvonne for the knots that kept him from
slipping when the gusts blew him to and fro. More
than once he thought it was all over; but the good
rope held fast, and strength and courage nerved heart
and limbs. One greater than St. Barbe upheld him,
and he dropped at last, breathless and bleeding,
beside the faithful Yvonne.</p>

<p>There was no time for words, only a grasp of the
hand, a sigh of gratitude, and they were away to the
boat that tossed on the wild water with a single rower
in his place.</p>

<p>"It is our Hol. I found him looking for you. He
is true as steel. In, in, and off, or you are lost!"
whispered Yvonne, flinging a cloak about Gaston,
thrusting a purse, a sword, and a flask into his hand,
and holding the boat while he leaped in.</p>

<p>"But you?" he cried; "I cannot leave you in peril,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
after all you have dared and done for me."</p>

<p>"No one suspects me; I am safe. Go to my
mother; she will hide you, and I will follow soon."</p>

<p>Waiting for no further speech, she pushed the boat
off, and watched it vanish in the darkness; then went
away to give thanks, and rest after her long work and
excitement.</p>

<p>Gaston reached home safely, and Dame Gillian concealed
him in the ruins of the Abbey, till anxiety for
Yvonne drove him out to seek and rescue in his turn.
For she did not come, and when a returning soldier
brought word that she had been arrested in her flight,
and sent to Nantes, Gaston could not rest, but disguising
himself as a peasant, went to find her, accompanied
by faithful Hol, who loved Yvonne, and would gladly
die for her and his young master. Their hearts sunk
when they discovered that she was in the Boufflay, an
old fortress, once a royal residence, and now a prison,
crowded with unfortunate and innocent creatures, arrested
on the slightest pretexts, and guillotined or
drowned by the infamous Carrier. Hundreds of men
and women were there, suffering terribly, and among
them was Yvonne, brave still, but with no hope of
escape; for few were saved, and then only by some
lucky accident. Like a sister of mercy she went among
the poor souls crowded together in the great halls,
hungry, cold, sick, and despairing, and they clung to
her as if she were some strong, sweet saint who could
deliver them or teach them how to die.</p>

<p>After some weeks of this terrible life, her name was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
called one morning, on the list for that day's execution,
and she rose to join the sad procession setting forth.</p>

<p>"Which is it to be?" she asked, as she passed one
of the men who guarded them, a rough fellow, whose
face was half hidden by a shaggy beard.</p>

<p>"You will be drowned; we have no time to waste
on women;" was the brutal answer; but as the words
passed his lips, a slip of paper was pressed into her
hand, and these words breathed into her ear by a
familiar voice: "I am here!"</p>

<p>It was Gaston, in the midst of enemies, bent on saving
her at the risk of his life, remembering all he owed
her, and the motto of his race. The shock of this discovery
nearly betrayed them both, and turned her so
white that the woman next her put her arm about her,
saying sweetly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Courage, my sister; it is soon over."</p>

<p>"I fear nothing now!" cried Yvonne, and went on
to take her place in the cart, looking so serene and
happy that those about her thought her already fit for
heaven.</p>

<p>No need to repeat the dreadful history of the
Noyades; it is enough to say that in the confusion of
the moment Yvonne found opportunity to read and
destroy the little paper, which said briefly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When you are flung into the river, call my name
and float. I shall be near."</p>

<p>She understood, and being placed with a crowd of
wretched women on the old vessel which lay in the
river Loire, she employed every moment in loosening
the rope that tied her hands, and keeping her eye on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the tall, bearded man who moved about seeming to do
his work, while his blood boiled with suppressed wrath,
and his heart ached with unavailing pity. It was dusk
before the end came for Yvonne, and she was all unnerved
by the sad sights she had been forced to see;
but when rude hands seized her, she made ready for
the plunge, sure that Gaston would "be near." He
was, for in the darkness and uproar, he could leap
after her unseen, and while she floated, he cut the rope,
then swam down the river with her hand upon his
shoulder till they dared to land. Both were nearly
spent with the excitement and exertion of that dreadful
hour; but Hol waited for them on the shore and
helped Gaston carry poor Yvonne into a deserted house,
where they gave her fire, food, dry garments, and the
gladdest welcome one human creature ever gave to
another.</p>

<p>Being a robust peasant, the girl came safely through
hardships that would have killed or crazed a frailer
creature; and she was soon able to rejoice with the
brave fellows over this escape, so audaciously planned
and so boldly carried out. They dared stay but a few
hours, and before dawn were hastening through the
least frequented ways toward home, finding safety in
the distracted state of the country, which made fugitives
no unusual sight, and refugees plentiful. One
more adventure, and that a happy one, completed their
joy, and turned their flight into a triumphant march.</p>

<p>Pausing in the depths of the great forest of Hunaudaye
to rest, the two young men went to find food,
leaving Yvonne to tend the fire and make ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
cook the venison they hoped to bring. It was nightfall,
and another day would see them in Dinan, they
hoped; but the lads had consented to pause for the
girl's sake, for she was worn out with their rapid flight.
They were talking of their adventures in high spirits,
when Gaston laid his hand on Hol's mouth and pointed
to a green slope before them. An early moon gave
light enough to show them a dark form moving quickly
into the coppice, and something like the antlers of a
stag showed above the tall brakes before they vanished.
"Slip around and drive him this way. I never miss
my aim, and we will sup royally to-night," whispered
Gaston, glad to use the arms with which they had provided
themselves.</p>

<p>Hol slipped away, and presently a rustle in the
wood betrayed the cautious approach of the deer. But
he was off before a shot could be fired, and the disappointed
hunters followed long and far, resolved not to
go back empty-handed. They had to give it up, however,
and were partially consoled by a rabbit, which
Hol flung over his shoulder, while Gaston, forgetting
caution, began to sing an old song the women of Brittany
love so well:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Quand vous tiez, captif, Bertrand, fils de Bretagne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tous les fuseaux tournaient aussi dans la campagne."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>He got no further, for the stanza was finished by a
voice that had often joined in the ballad, when Dame
Gillian sang it to the children, as she spun:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Chaque femme apporte son cheveau de lin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ce fut votre ranon, Messire du Guesclin."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Both paused, thinking that some spirit of the wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
mocked them; but a loud laugh, and a familiar
"Holo! holo!" made Hol cry, "The forester!" while
Gaston dashed headlong into the thicket whence the
sound came, there to find the jolly forester, indeed,
with a slain deer by his side, waiting to receive them
with open arms.</p>

<p>"I taught you to stalk the deer, and spear the boar,
not to hunt your fellow-creatures, my lord. But I forgive
you, for it was well done, and I had a hard run to
escape," he said, still laughing.</p>

<p>"But how came you here?" cried both the youths,
in great excitement; for the good man was supposed
to be dead, with his old master.</p>

<p>"A long tale, for which I have a short and happy
answer. Come home to supper with me, and I'll show
you a sight that will gladden hearts and eyes," he
answered, shouldering his load and leading the way to
a deserted hermitage, which had served many a fugitive
for a shelter. As they went, Gaston poured out
his story, and told how Yvonne was waiting for them
in the wood.</p>

<p>"Brave lads! and here is your reward," answered
the forester, pushing open the door and pointing to the
figure of a man, with a pale face and bandaged head,
lying asleep beside the fire.</p>

<p>It was the count, sorely wounded, but alive, thanks
to his devoted follower, who had saved him when the
fight was over; and after weeks of concealment, suffering,
and anxiety, had brought him so far toward
home.</p>

<p>No need to tell of the happy meeting that night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
nor of the glad return; for, though the chateau was in
ruins and lives were still in danger, they all were together,
and the trials they had passed through only
made the ties of love and loyalty between high and
low more true and tender. Good Dame Gillian housed
them all, and nursed her master back to health.
Yvonne and Hol had a gay wedding in the course of
time, and Gaston went to the wars again. A new chateau
rose on the ruins of the old, and when the young
lord took possession, he replaced the banner that was
lost with one of fair linen, spun and woven by the two
women who had been so faithful to him and his, but
added a white dove above the clasped hands and golden
legend, never so true as now,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of her? She has only
been here a day, but it doesn't take <i>us</i> long to make
up our minds," said Nelly Blake, the leader of the
school, as a party of girls stood chatting round the
register one cold November morning.</p>

<p>"I like her, she looks so fresh and pleasant, and so
strong. I just wanted to go and lean up against her,
when my back ached yesterday," answered Maud, a
pale girl wrapped in a shawl.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid she's very energetic, and I do hate to be
hurried," sighed plump Cordelia, lounging in an easy
chair.</p>

<p>"I know she is, for Biddy says she asked for a pail
of cold water at six this morning, and she's out walking
now. Just think how horrid," cried Kitty with
a shiver.</p>

<p>"I wonder what she does for her complexion. Never
saw such a lovely color. Real roses and cream," said
Julia, shutting one eye to survey the freckles on her
nose, with a gloomy frown.</p>

<p>"I longed to ask what sort of braces she wears, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
keep her so straight. I mean to by and by; she looks
as if she wouldn't snub a body;" and Sally vainly tried
to square her own round shoulders, bent with much poring
over books, for she was the bright girl of the school.</p>

<p>"She wears French corsets, of course. Nothing else
gives one such a fine figure," answered Maud, dropping
the shawl to look with pride at her own wasp-like waist
and stiff back.</p>

<p>"Couldn't move about so easily and gracefully if
she wore a strait-jacket like you. She's not a bit of
a fashion plate, but a splendid woman, just natural and
hearty and sweet. I feel as if I shouldn't slouch and
poke so much if I had her to brace me up," cried Sally,
in her enthusiastic way.</p>

<p>"I know one thing, girls, and that is, <i>she</i> can wear
a jersey and have it set elegantly, and <i>we</i> can't," said
Kitty, laboring with her own, which would wrinkle
and twist, in spite of many hidden pins.</p>

<p>"Yes, I looked at it all breakfast time, and forgot
my second cup of coffee, so my head aches as if it
would split. Never saw anything fit so splendidly in
my life," answered Nelly, turning to the mirror, which
reflected a fine assortment of many colored jerseys; for
all the girls were out in their fall suits, and not one of
the new jackets set like Miss Orne's, the teacher who
had arrived to take Madame's place while that excellent
old lady was laid up with a rheumatic fever.</p>

<p>"They are pretty and convenient, but I'm afraid
they will be a trial to some of us. Maud and Nelly
look the best, but they have to keep stiff and still, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the wrinkles come. Kit has no peace in hers, and poor
Cordy looks more like a meal bag than ever, while I
am a perfect spectacle, with my round shoulders and
long thin arms. 'A jersey on a bean-pole' describes me;
but let us be in the fashion or die," laughed Sally,
exaggerating her own defects by poking her head forward
and blinking through her glasses in a funny way.</p>

<p>There was a laugh and then a pause, broken in a
moment by Maud, who said, in a tone of apprehension:</p>

<p>"I do hope Miss Orne isn't full of the new notions
about clothes and food and exercise and rights and
rubbish of that sort. Mamma hates such ideas, and so
do I."</p>

<p>"I hope she <i>is</i> full of good, wise notions about health
and work and study. It is just what we need in this
school. Madame is old and lets things go, and the other
teachers only care to get through and have an easy
time. We ought to be a great deal better, brisker, and
wiser than we are, and I'm ready for a good stirring
up if any one will give it to us," declared Sally, who
was a very independent girl and had read as well as
studied much.</p>

<p>"You Massachusetts girls are always raving about
self-culture, and ready for queer new ways. I'm contented
with the old ones, and want to be let alone and
finished off easily," said Nelly, the pretty New Yorker.</p>

<p>"Well, I go with Sally, and want to get all I can in
the way of health, learning, and manners while I'm
here; and I'm real glad Miss Orne has come, for Madame's
old-fashioned, niminy priminy ways did fret me
dreadfully. Miss Orne is more like our folks out West,&mdash;spry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and strong and smart, see if she isn't," said
Julia, with a decided nod of her auburn head.</p>

<p>"There she is now! Girls, she's running! actually
trotting up the avenue&mdash;not like a hen, but a boy&mdash;with
her elbows down and her head up. Do come and
see!" cried Kitty, dancing about at the window as if
she longed to go and do likewise.</p>

<p>All ran in time to see a tall young lady come up the
wide path at a good pace, looking as fresh and blithe
as the goddess of health, as she smiled and nodded at
them, so like a girl that all returned her salute with
equal cordiality.</p>

<p>"She gives a new sort of interest to the old treadmill,
doesn't she?" said Nelly, as they scattered to
their places at the stroke of nine, feeling unusually
anxious to appear well before the new teacher.</p>

<p>While they pull down their jerseys and take up their
books, we will briefly state that Madame Stein's select
boarding-school had for many years received six girls at
a time, and finished them off in the old style. Plenty
of French, German, music, painting, dancing, and deportment
turned out well-bred, accomplished, and amiable
young ladies, ready for fashionable society, easy
lives, and entire dependence on other people. Dainty
and delicate creatures usually, for, as in most schools of
this sort, minds and manners were much cultivated, but
bodies rather neglected. Heads and backs ached, dyspepsia
was a common ailment, and poorlies of all sorts
afflicted the dear girls, who ought not to have known
what "nerves" meant, and should have had no bottles
in their closets holding wine and iron, cough mixtures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
soothing drops and cod-liver oil for weak lungs. Gymnastics
had once flourished, but the fashion had gone
by, and a short walk each day was all the exercise they
took, though they might have had glorious romps in
the old coach-house and bowling-alley in bad weather,
and lovely rambles about the spacious grounds; for the
house was in the suburbs, and had once been a fine
country mansion. Some of the liveliest girls did race
down the avenue now and then, when Madame was
away, and one irrepressible creature had actually slid
down the wide balusters, to the horror of the entire
household.</p>

<p>In cold weather all grew lazy and cuddled under
blankets and around registers, like so many warmth-loving
pussies,&mdash;poor Madame's rheumatism making
her enjoy a hot-house temperature and indulge the girls
in luxurious habits. Now she had been obliged to give
up entirely and take to her bed, saying, with the resignation
of an indolent nature:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If Anna Orne takes charge of the school I shall
feel no anxiety. <i>She</i> is equal to anything."</p>

<p>She certainly looked so as she came into the school-room
ready for her day's work, with lungs full of
fresh air, brain stimulated by sound sleep, wholesome
exercise, and a simple breakfast, and a mind much interested
in the task before her. The girls' eyes followed
her as she took her place, involuntarily attracted by
the unusual spectacle of a robust woman. Everything
about her seemed so fresh, harmonious, and happy, that
it was a pleasure to see the brilliant color in her cheeks,
the thick coils of glossy hair on her spirited head, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
flash of white teeth as she spoke, and the clear, bright
glance of eyes both keen and kind. But the most
admiring glances were on the dark-blue jersey that
showed such fine curves of the broad shoulders, round
waist, and plump arms, without a wrinkle to mar its
smooth perfection.</p>

<p>Girls are quick to see what is genuine, to respect
what is strong, and to love what is beautiful; so before
that day was over, Miss Orne had charmed them all; for
they felt that she was not only able to teach but to
help and amuse them.</p>

<p>After tea the other teachers went to their rooms, glad
to be free from the chatter of half a dozen lively tongues;
but Miss Orne remained in the drawing-room, and set
the girls to dancing till they were tired, then gathered
them round the long table to do what they liked till
prayer-time. Some had novels, others did fancy-work
or lounged, and all wondered what the new teacher
would do next.</p>

<p>Six pairs of curious eyes were fixed upon her, as she
sat sewing on some queer bits of crash, and six lively
fancies vainly tried to guess what the articles were,
for no one was rude enough to ask. Presently she
tried on a pair of mittens, and surveyed them with
satisfaction, saying as she caught Kitty staring with
uncontrollable interest:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These are my beautifiers, and I never like to be
without them."</p>

<p>"Are they to keep your hands white?" asked Maud,
who spent a good deal of time in caring for her own. "I
wear old kid gloves at night after cold-creaming mine."</p>

<p>"I wear these for five minutes night and morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
for a good rub, after dipping them in cold water.
Thanks to these rough friends, I seldom feel the cold,
get a good color, and keep well," answered Miss Orne,
polishing up her smooth cheek till it looked like a
rosy apple.</p>

<p>"I'd like the color, but not the crash. Must it be
so rough, and with <i>cold</i> water?" asked Maud, who
often privately rubbed her pale face with a bit of red
flannel, rouge being forbidden except for theatricals.</p>

<p>"Best so; but there are other ways to get a color.
Run up and down the avenue three or four times
a day, eat no pastry, and go to bed early," said Miss
Orne, whose sharp eye had spied out the little weaknesses
of the girls, and whose kind heart longed to
help them at once.</p>

<p>"It makes my back ache to run, and Madame says
we are too old now."</p>

<p>"Never too old to care for one's health, my dear.
Better run now than lie on a sofa by and by, with a
back that never stops aching."</p>

<p>"Do you cure your headaches in that way?" asked
Nelly, rubbing her forehead wearily.</p>

<p>"I never have them;" and Miss Orne's bright eyes
were full of pity for all pain.</p>

<p>"What do you do to help it?" cried Nelly, who
firmly believed that it was inevitable.</p>

<p>"I give my brain plenty of rest, air, and good food.
I never know I have any nerves, except in the enjoyment
they give me, for I have learned how to use them.
I was not brought up to believe that I was born an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
invalid, and was taught to understand the beautiful
machinery God gave me, and to keep it religiously in
order."</p>

<p>Miss Orne spoke so seriously that there was a brief
pause in which the girls were wishing that some one
had taught them this lesson and made them as strong
and lovely as their new teacher.</p>

<p>"If crash mittens would make my jersey set like
yours I'd have a pair at once," said Cordy, sadly
eyeing the buttons on her own, which seemed in danger
of flying off if their plump wearer moved too
quickly.</p>

<p>"Brisk runs are what you want, and less confectionery,
sleep, and lounging in easy chairs;" began
Miss Orne, all ready to prescribe for these poor girls,
the most important part of whose education had been
so neglected.</p>

<p>"Why, how did you know?" said Cordy, blushing,
as she bounced out of her luxurious seat and whisked
into her pocket the paper of chocolate creams she was
seldom without.</p>

<p>Her round eyes and artless surprise set the others
to laughing, and gave Sally courage to ask what she
wanted, then and there.</p>

<p>"Miss Orne, I wish you would show us how to be
strong and hearty, for I do think girls are a feeble
set now-a-days. We certainly need stirring up, and
I hope you will kindly do it. Please begin with me,
then the others will see that I mean what I say."</p>

<p>Miss Orne looked up at the tall, overgrown girl
who stood before her, with broad forehead, near-sighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
eyes, and narrow chest of a student; not at
all what a girl of seventeen should be, physically,
though a clear mind and a brave spirit shone in her
clever face and sounded in her resolute voice.</p>

<p>"I shall very gladly do what I can for you, my
dear. It is very simple, and I am sure that a few
months of my sort of training will help you much;
for you are just the kind of girl who should have a
strong body, to keep pace with a very active brain,"
answered Miss Orne, taking Sally's thin, inky fingers
in her own, with a friendly pressure that showed her
good will.</p>

<p>"Madame says violent exercise is not good for
girls, so we gave up gymnastics long ago," said Maud,
in her languid voice, wishing that Sally would not
suggest disagreeable things.</p>

<p>"One does not need clubs, dumb bells, and bars for
my style of exercise. Let me show you;" and rising,
Miss Orne went through a series of energetic but
graceful evolutions, which put every muscle in play
without great exertion.</p>

<p>"That looks easy enough," began Nelly.</p>

<p>"Try it," answered Miss Orne, with a sparkle of fun
in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>They did try,&mdash;to the great astonishment of the
solemn portraits on the wall, unused to seeing such
antics in that dignified apartment. But some of the
girls were out of breath in five minutes; others could
not lift their arms over their heads; Maud and Nelly
broke several bones in their corsets, trying to stoop;
and Kitty tumbled down, in her efforts to touch her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
toes without bending her knees. Sally got on the
best of all, being long of limb, easy in her clothes, and
full of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Pretty well for beginners," said Miss Orne, as they
paused at last, flushed and merry. "Do that regularly
every day, and you will soon gain a few inches across
the chest and fill out the new jerseys with firm, elastic
figures."</p>

<p>"Like yours," added Sally, with a face full of such
honest admiration that it could not offend.</p>

<p>Seeing that she had made one convert, and knowing
that girls, like sheep, are sure to follow a leader, Miss
Orne said no more then, but waited for the leaven to
work. The others called it one of Sally's notions,
but were interested to see how she would get on, and
had great fun, when they went to bed, watching her
faithful efforts to imitate her teacher's rapid and effective
motions.</p>

<p>"The wind-mill is going!" cried Kitty, as several
of them sat on the bed, laughing at the long arms
swinging about.</p>

<p>"That is the hygienic elbow-exercise, and that the
Orne Quickstep, a mixture of the grasshopper's skip
and the water-bug's slide," added Julia, humming a
tune in time to the stamp of the other's foot.</p>

<p>"We will call these the Jersey Jymnastics, and spell
the last with a J, my dear," said Nelly; and the name
was received with as much applause as the young
ladies dared to give it at that hour.</p>

<p>"Laugh on, but see if you don't all follow my
example sooner or later, when I become a model of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
grace, strength, and beauty," retorted Sally, as she
turned them out and went to bed, tingling all over
with a delicious glow that sent the blood from her hot
head to warm her cold feet, and bring her the sound,
refreshing sleep she so much needed.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of a new order of things,
for Miss Orne carried her energy into other matters
besides gymnastics, and no one dared oppose her when
Madame shut her ears to all complaints, saying, "Obey
her in everything, and don't trouble me."</p>

<p>Pitchers of fresh milk took the place of tea and
coffee; cake and pie were rarely seen, but better
bread, plain puddings, and plenty of fruit.</p>

<p>Rooms were cooled off, feather beds sent up garret,
and thick curtains abolished. Sun and air streamed
in, and great cans of water appeared suggestively at
doors in the morning. Earlier hours were kept, and
brisk walks taken by nearly all the girls; for Miss
Orne baited her hook cleverly, and always had some
pleasant project to make the wintry expeditions inviting.
There were games in the parlor instead of
novels, and fancy-work in the evening; shorter lessons,
and longer talks on the many useful subjects that
are best learned from the lips of a true teacher. A
cooking class was started, not to make fancy dishes,
but the plain, substantial ones all housewives should
understand. Several girls swept their own rooms, and
liked it after they saw Miss Orne do hers in a becoming
dust-cap; and these same pioneers, headed by Sally,
boldly coasted on the hill, swung clubs in the coach-house,
and played tag in the bowling-alley rainy days.</p>

<p>It took time to work these much-needed changes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
but young people like novelty; the old routine had
grown tiresome, and Miss Orne made things so lively
and pleasant it was impossible to resist her wishes.
Sally did begin to straighten up, after a month or
two of regular training; Maud outgrew both corsets
and backache; Nelly got a fresh color; Kitty found
her thin arms developing visible muscles; and Julia
considered herself a Von Hillern, after walking ten
miles without fatigue.</p>

<p>But dear, fat Cordy was the most successful of
all; and rejoiced greatly over the loss of a few
pounds when she gave up over-eating, long naps, and
lazy habits. Exercise became a sort of mania with
her, and she was continually trudging off for a constitutional,
or trotting up and down the halls when
bad weather prevented the daily tramp. It was the
desire of her soul to grow thin, and such was her
ardor that Miss Orne had to check her sometimes, lest
she should overdo the matter.</p>

<p>"All this is easy and pleasant now, because it is
new," she said, "and there is no one to criticise our
simple, sensible ways; but when you go away I am
afraid you will undo the good I have tried to
do you. People will ridicule you, fashion will condemn,
and frivolous pleasures make our wholesome
ones seem hard. Can you be steadfast, and keep
on?"</p>

<p>"We will!" cried all the girls; but the older ones
looked a little anxious, as they thought of going home
to introduce the new ways alone.</p>

<p>Miss Orne shook her head, earnestly wishing that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
could impress the important lesson indelibly upon them;
and very soon something happened which had that effect.</p>

<p>April came, and the snowdrops and crocuses were
up in the garden beds. Madame was able to sit at
her window, peering out like a dormouse waking from
its winter sleep; and much did the good lady
wonder at the blooming faces turned up to nod and
smile at her, the lively steps that tripped about the
house, and the amazing spectacle of <i>her</i> young ladies
racing round the lawn as if they liked it. No one
knew how Miss Orne reconciled her to this new style
of deportment; but she made no complaint,&mdash;only
shook her impressive cap when the girls came beaming
in to pay little visits, full of happy chat about their
affairs. They seemed to take a real interest in their
studies now, to be very happy; and all looked so
well that the wise old lady said to herself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Looks are everything with women, and I have
never been able to show such a bouquet of blooming
creatures at my breaking up as I shall this year. I
will let well enough alone, and if fault is found, dear
Anna's shoulders are broad enough to bear it."</p>

<p>Things were in this promising state, and all were
busily preparing for the May fte, at which time this
class of girls would graduate, when the mysterious
events occurred to which we have alluded.</p>

<p>They were gathered&mdash;the girls, not the events&mdash;round
the table one night, discussing, with the deep
interest befitting such an important topic, what they
should wear on examination day.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> think white silk jerseys and pink or blue skirts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
would be lovely; so pretty and so appropriate for the
J. J. Club, and so nice for us to do our exercises in.
Miss Orne wants us to show how well we go together,
and of course we want to please her;" said Nelly
taking the lead as usual in matters of taste.</p>

<p>"Of course!" cried all the girls, with an alacrity
which plainly showed how entirely the new friend had
won their hearts.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have believed that six months could
make such a difference in one's figure and feelings,"
said Maud, surveying her waist with calm satisfaction,
though it was no longer slender, but in perfect proportion
to the rest of her youthful shape.</p>

<p>"I've had to let out every dress, and it's a mercy
I'm going home, for I shouldn't be decent if I kept on
at this rate;" and Julia took a long breath, proud of
her broad chest, expanded by plenty of exercise, and
loose clothing.</p>

<p>"I take mine in, and don't have to worry about my
buttons flying off, <i> la</i> Clara Peggotty. I'm <i>so</i> pleased
I want to be training all the time, for I'm not half
thin enough yet," said Cordy, jumping up for a
trot round the room, that not a moment might be
lost.</p>

<p>"Come, Sally, you ought to join in the jubilee, for
you have done wonders, and will be as straight as a
ramrod in a little while. Why so sober to-night? Is
it because our dear Miss Orne leaves us to sit with
Madame?" asked Nelly, missing the gayest voice of
the six, and observing her friend's troubled face.</p>

<p>"I'm making up my mind whether I'd better tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
you something or not. Don't want to scare the
servants, trouble Madame, or vex Miss Orne; for I
know <i>she</i> wouldn't believe a word of it, though I saw
it with my own eyes," answered Sally, in such a mysterious
tone that the girls with one voice cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell us, this minute!"</p>

<p>"I will; and perhaps some of you can explain the
matter."</p>

<p>As she spoke, Sally rose and stood on the rug with
her hands behind her, looking rather wild and queer;
for her short hair was in a toss, her eyes shone large
behind her round glasses, and her voice sank to a
whisper as she made this startling announcement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've seen a ghost!"</p>

<p>A general shiver pervaded the listeners, and Cordy
poked her head under the sofa pillows with a faint cry,
while the rest involuntarily drew nearer to one
another.</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded Julia, the bravest of the
party.</p>

<p>"On the top of the house."</p>

<p>"Good gracious! When, Sally?" "What did it
look like?" "Don't scare us for fun,"&mdash;cried the
girls, undecided whether to take this startling story
in jest or earnest.</p>

<p>"Listen, and I'll tell you all about it," answered
Sally, holding up her finger impressively.</p>

<p>"Night before last I sat till eleven, studying.
Against the rules, I know; but I forgot, and when I
was through I opened my window to air the room. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was bright moonlight, so I took a stroll along the top
of the piazza, and coming back with my eyes on the
sky I naturally saw the roof of the main house from
my wing. I couldn't have been asleep, could I?
yet, I solemnly declare I saw a white figure with a
veil over its head roaming to and fro as quietly as a
shadow. I looked and looked, then I called softly,
but it never answered, and suddenly it was gone."</p>

<p>"What did you do? quavered Cordy, in a smothered
voice from under the pillow.</p>

<p>"Went straight in, took my lamp and marched up
to the cupola. Not a sign of any one, all locked and
the floor dusty, for we never go there now, you know. I
didn't like it, but just said, 'Sally, go to bed; it's an
optical illusion and serves you right for studying
against the rule.' That was the first time."</p>

<p>"Mercy on us! Did you see it again?" cried Maud,
getting hold of Julia's strong arm for protection.</p>

<p>"Yes, in the bowling-alley at midnight," whispered
Sally.</p>

<p>"Do shut the door, Kit, and don't keep clutching
at me in that scary way; it's very unpleasant," said
Nelly, glancing nervously over her shoulder as the six
pairs of wide-opened eyes were fixed on Sally.</p>

<p>"I got up to shut my window last night, and saw
a light in the alley. A dim one, but bright enough
to show me the same white thing going up and down,
with the veil as before. I'll confess I was nervous
then, for you know there <i>is</i> a story that in old times
the man who lived here wouldn't let his daughter
marry the lover she wanted, and she pined away and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
died, and said she'd haunt the cruel father, and she
did. Old Mrs. Foster told me all about it when I first
came, and Madame asked me not to repeat it, so I
never did. I don't believe in ghosts, mind you, but
what on earth is it, trailing about in that ridiculous
way?"</p>

<p>Sally spoke nervously and looked excited, for in
spite of courage and common sense she <i>was</i> worried
to account for the apparition.</p>

<p>"How long did it stay?" asked Julia, with her arm
round Maud, who was trembling and pale.</p>

<p>"A good fifteen minutes by my watch, then vanished,
light and all, as suddenly as before. I didn't
go to look after it that time, but if I see it again I'll
hunt till I find out what it is. Who will go with
me?"</p>

<p>No one volunteered, and Cordy emerged long enough
to say imploringly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do tell Miss Orne, or get the police;" then dived
out of sight again, and lay quaking like an ostrich with
its head in the sand.</p>

<p>"I won't! Miss Orne would think I was a fool, and
the police don't arrest ghosts. I'll do it myself, and
Julia will help me, I know. She is the bravest of you,
and hasn't developed her biceps for nothing," said
Sally, bent on keeping all the glory of the capture to
themselves if possible.</p>

<p>Flattered by the compliment to her arms, Julia did
not decline the invitation, but made a very sensible
suggestion, which was a great relief to the timid, till
Sally added a new fancy to haunt them.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is one of the servants moon-struck or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
love-lorn. Myra looks sentimental, and is always
singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0"><br />"I'm waiting, waiting, darling,</span>
<span class="i0"><br />Morning, night, and noon;</span>
<span class="i0">Oh, meet me by the river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When softly shines the moon."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>"It's not Myra; I asked her, and she turned pale
at the mere idea of going anywhere alone after dark,
and said cook had seen a banshee gliding down the
Lady's Walk one night, when she got up for camphor,
having the face-ache. I said no more, not wanting
to scare them; ignorant people are so superstitious."</p>

<p>Sally paused, and the girls all tried not to look
"scared" or "superstitious," but did not succeed very
well.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Nelly, in a
respectful tone, as Julia and Sally stood side by side,
like Horatius and Herminius waiting for a Spurius
Lartius to join them.</p>

<p>"Watch, like cats for a mouse, and pounce as soon
as possible. All promise to say nothing; then we
can't be laughed at if it turns out some silly thing, as
it probably will," answered Sally.</p>

<p>"We promise!" solemnly answered the girls, feeling
deeply impressed with the thrilling interest of the
moment.</p>

<p>"Very well; now don't talk about it or think
about it till we report, or no one will sleep a wink,"
said Sally, walking off with her ally as coolly as if,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
after frightening them out of their wits, they could
forget the matter at word of command.</p>

<p>The oath of silence was well kept, but lessons suffered,
and so did sleep, for the excitement was great,
especially in the morning, when the watchers reported
the events of the night, and in the evening, when they
took turns to go on guard. There was much whisking
of dressing-gowns up and down the corridor of the
west wing, where our six roomed, as the girls flew to
ask questions early each day, or scurried to bed, glancing
behind them for the banshee as they went.</p>

<p>Miss Orne observed the whispers, nods, and eager
confabulations, but said nothing, for Madame had
confided to her that the young ladies were planning
a farewell gift for her. So she was blind and deaf, and
smiled at the important airs of her girlish admirers.</p>

<p>Three or four days passed, and no sign of the ghost
appeared. The boldest openly scoffed at the false alarm,
and the most timid began to recover from their fright.</p>

<p>Sally and Julia looked rather foolish as they answered,
"no news," morning after morning, to the
inquiries which were rapidly losing the breathless
eagerness so flattering to the watchers.</p>

<p>"You dreamed it, Sally. Go to sleep, and don't do
it again," said Nelly, on the fifth day, as she made her
evening call and found the girls yawning and cross for
want of rest.</p>

<p>"She has exercised too much, and produced a morbid
state of the brain," laughed Maud.</p>

<p>"I just wish she wouldn't scare me out of my senses
for nothing," grumbled Cordy; "I used to sleep like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
a dormouse, and now I dream dreadfully and wake up
tired out. Come along, Kit, and let the old ghosts
carry off these silly creatures."</p>

<p>"My regards to the Woman in White <i>when</i> you see
her again, dear," added Kitty, as the four went off to
laugh at the whole thing, though they carefully locked
their doors and took a peep out of window before
going to sleep.</p>

<p>"We may as well give it up and have a good rest.
I'm worn out, and so are you, if you'd own it," said
Julia, throwing herself down for a nap before midnight.</p>

<p>"I shall <i>not</i> give it up till I'm satisfied. Sleep
away, I'll read awhile and call you if anything comes,"
answered Sally, bound to prove the truth of her story
if she waited all summer.</p>

<p>Julia was soon off, and the lonely watcher sat reading
till past eleven; then put out her light and went
to take a turn on the flat roof of the piazza that ran
round the house, for the night was mild and the stars
companionable. As she turned to come back, her
sharp eye caught sight of something moving on the
house-top as before, and soon, clear against the soft
gloom of the sky, appeared the white figure flitting
to and fro.</p>

<p>A long look, and then Sally made a rush at Julia,
shaking her violently as she said in an excited whisper:</p>

<p>"Come! she is there. Quick! upstairs to the cupola;
I have the candle and the key."</p>

<p>Carried away by the other's vehemence Julia mutely
obeyed, trembling, but afraid to resist; and noiseless as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
two shadows, they crept up the stairs, arriving just in
time to see the ghost vanish over the edge of the roof,
as if it had dissolved into thin air. Julia dropped
down in a heap, desperately frightened, but Sally pulled
her up and led her back to their room, saying, when she
got there, with grim satisfaction, "Did I dream it all?
Now I hope they will believe me."</p>

<p>"What was it? Oh, what could it be?" whimpered
Julia, quite demoralized by the spectacle.</p>

<p>"I begin to believe in ghosts, for no human being
could fly off in that way, with nothing to walk on. I
shall speak to Miss Orne to-morrow; I've had enough
of this sort of fun," said Sally, going to the window,
with a strong desire to shut and lock it.</p>

<p>But she paused with her hand raised, as if turned to
stone, for as she spoke the white figure went slowly by.
Julia dived into the closet, with one spring. Sally, however,
was on her mettle now, and, holding her breath,
leaned out to watch. With soundless steps the veiled
thing went along the roof, and paused at the further end.</p>

<p>Never waiting for her comrade, Sally quietly stepped
out and followed, leaving Julia to quake with fear and
listen for an alarm.</p>

<p>None came, and in a few minutes, that seemed like
hours, Sally returned, looking much excited; but was
sternly silent, and, to all the other's eager questions she
would only give this mysterious reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know all, but cannot tell till morning. Go to
sleep."</p>

<p>Believing her friend offended at her base desertion
at the crisis of the affair, Julia curbed her curiosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and soon forgot it in sleep. Sally slept also, feeling
like a hero reposing after a hard-won battle.</p>

<p>She was up betimes and ready to receive her early
visitors with an air of triumph, which silenced every
jeer and convinced the most skeptical that she had
something sensational to tell at last.</p>

<p>When the girls had perched themselves on any available
article of furniture, they waited with respectful
eagerness, while Sally retired to the hall for a moment,
and Julia rolled her eyes, with her finger on her lips,
looking as if she could tell much if she dared.</p>

<p>Sally returned somewhat flushed, but very sober, and
in a few dramatic words related the adventures of the
night, up to the point where she left Julia quivering
ignominiously in the closet, and, like Horatius, faced
the foe alone.</p>

<p>"I followed till the ghost entered a window."</p>

<p>"Which?" demanded five awestruck voices at once.</p>

<p>"The last."</p>

<p>"Ours?" whispered Kitty, pale as her collar, while
Cordy, her room-mate, sat aghast.</p>

<p>"As it turned to shut the window the veil fell back
and I saw the face." Sally spoke in a whisper and
added, with a sudden start, "I see it now!"</p>

<p>Every girl sprang or tumbled off her perch as if an
electric shock had moved them, and stared about them
as Nelly cried wildly, "Where? oh, where?"</p>

<p>"There!" and Sally pointed at the palest face in
the room, while her own reddened with the mirth she
was vainly trying to suppress.</p>

<p>"Cordy?"</p>

<p>A general shriek of amazement and incredulity followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the question, while Sally laughed till the tears
ran down her cheeks at the dumb dismay of the innocent
ghost.</p>

<p>As soon as she could be heard she quickly explained:
"Yes, it was Cordy, walking in her sleep.
She wore her white flannel wrapper, and a cloud round
her head, and took her exercise over the roofs at midnight,
so that no time might be lost. I don't wonder
she is tired in the morning, after such dangerous
gymnastics as these."</p>

<p>"But she couldn't vanish in that strange way off
the house-top without breaking her neck," said Julia,
much relieved, but still mystified.</p>

<p>"She didn't fly nor fall, but went down the ladder
left by the painters. Look at the soles of her felt
slippers, if you doubt me, and see the red paint from
the roof. We couldn't open the cupola windows, you
remember, but this morning I took a stroll and looked
up and saw how she did it asleep, though she never
would dare to do it awake. Somnambulists do dreadfully
dangerous things, you know," said Sally, as if her
experience of those peculiar people had been vast and
varied.</p>

<p>"How could I? It's horrid to think of. Why
did you let me, Kit?" cried Cordy, uncertain whether
to be proud or ashamed of her exploit.</p>

<p>"Never dreamed of <i>your</i> doing such a silly thing,
and never waked up. Sleep-walkers are always quiet,
and if I had seen you I'd have been too scared to
know you. I'll tie you to the bed-post after this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and not let you scare the whole house," answered Kitty,
regarding it all as a fine joke.</p>

<p>"What did I do when I got in?" asked Cordy, curiously.</p>

<p>"Took off your things and went to bed as if glad
to get back. I didn't dare to wake you, and kept the
fun all to myself till this morning. Thought I ought
to have a good laugh for my pains since I did all the
work," answered Sally, in high glee at the success of
her efforts.</p>

<p>"I did want to get as thin as I could before I went
home, the boys plague me so; and I suppose it wore
upon me and set me to walking at night. I'm very
sorry, and I never will again if I can help it. Please
forgive me, and don't tell any one but Miss Orne; it
was so silly," begged poor Cordy, tearfully.</p>

<p>All promised and comforted her, and praised Sally,
and plagued Julia, and had a delightfully noisy and
exciting half hour before the breakfast bell rang.</p>

<p>Miss Orne wondered what made the young faces so
gay and the laughter so frequent, as mysterious hints
and significant nods went on around the table; but as
soon as possible she was borne into the school-room and
told the thrilling tale.</p>

<p>Her interest and surprise were very flattering, and
when the subject had been well discussed she promised
to prevent any further escapades of this sort, and advised
Cordy to try the Banting method for the few remaining
weeks of her stay.</p>

<p>"I'll try anything that will keep me from acting
ghost and making every one afraid of me," said Cordy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
secretly wondering why she had not broken her neck
in her nocturnal gymnastics.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in ghosts, Miss Orne?" asked
Maud,&mdash;who did, in spite of the comic explanation
of this one.</p>

<p>"Not the old-fashioned sort, but there is a modern
kind that we are all afraid of more or less," answered
Miss Orne, with a half-playful, half-serious look at the
girls around her.</p>

<p>"Do tell about them, please," begged Kitty, while
the rest looked both surprised and interested.</p>

<p>"There is one which I am very anxious to keep you
from fearing. Women are especially haunted by it,
and it prevents them from doing, being, and thinking
all that they might and ought. 'What will people
say?' is the name of this formidable ghost; and it does
much harm, for few of us have the courage to live up
to what we know to be right in all things. You are
soon to go away to begin your lives in earnest, and I
do hope that whatever I have been able to teach you
about the care of minds and bodies will not be forgotten
or neglected because it may not be the fashion
outside our little world."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> never will forget, or be afraid of that ghost, Miss
Orne," cried Sally, quick to understand and accept the
warning so opportunely given.</p>

<p>"I have great faith in <i>you</i>, dear, because you have
proved yourself so brave in facing phantoms more easily
laid. But this is a hard one to meet and vanquish; so
watch well, stand firm, and let these jerseys that you
are so fond of cover not only healthy young bodies but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
happy hearts, both helping you to be sweet, wise, and
useful women in the years to come. Dear girls, promise
me this, and I shall feel that our winter has not
been wasted, and that our spring is full of lovely
promise for a splendid summer."</p>

<p>As she spoke, with her own beautiful face bright
with hope and tenderness, Miss Orne opened her arms
and gathered them all in, to seal their promise with
grateful kisses more eloquent than words.</p>

<p>Long after their school days were over, the six girls
kept the white jerseys they wore at the breaking-up
festival, as relics of the J. J.; and long after they were
scattered far apart, they remembered the lessons which
helped them to be what their good friend hoped&mdash;healthy,
happy, and useful women.</p>

<p>"I think we little ones ought to
have a story all to ourselves now,"
said one of the smaller lads, as they
gathered round the fire with unabated interest.</p>

<p>"So do I, and I've got a little tale that will just
suit you, I fancy. The older boys and girls can go
and play games if they don't care to hear," answered
Aunt Elinor, producing the well-worn portfolio.</p>

<p>"Thanks, we will try a bit, and if it is very namby
pamby we can run," said Geoff, catching sight of the
name of the first chapter. Aunt Elinor smiled and
began to read about</p>

<h4>THE LITTLE HOUSE IN THE GARDEN</h4>

<div class='center'>I. <span class="smcap">Bears.</span></div>

<p>A brown bear was the first tenant; in fact, it was
built for him, and this is the way it happened:&mdash;</p>

<p>A man and his wife were driving through the woods
up among the mountains, and hearing a queer sound
looked about them till they spied two baby bears in
a tree.</p>

<p>"Those must be the cubs of the old bear that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
killed last week," said Mr. Hitchcock, much interested
all at once.</p>

<p>"Poor little things! how will they get on without
their mother? They look half scared to death,
and cry like real babies," said the kind woman.</p>

<p>"They will starve if we don't take care of them.
I'll shake them down; you catch them in your shawl
and we'll see what we can do for them."</p>

<p>So Mr. Hitchcock climbed up the tree, to the great
dismay of the two orphans, who growled funny little
growls and crept as far out on the branch as they dared.</p>

<p>"Shake easy, John, or they will fall and be killed,"
cried the wife, holding out her shawl for this new kind
of fruit to fall into.</p>

<p>Down they came, one after the other, and at first
were too frightened to fight; so Mr. Hitchcock got
them into the wagon safely bundled up, and Mrs.
Hitchcock soothed their alarm by gentle pattings and
motherly words, till they ceased to struggle, and cuddled
down to sleep like two confiding puppies, for
they were not much bigger.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchcock kept the hotel that stood at the foot
of the king of the mountains, and in summer the
house was full of people; so he was glad of any new
attraction, and the little bears were the delight of
many children. At first, Tom and Jerry trotted and
tumbled about like frolicsome puppies, and led easy
lives,&mdash;petted, fed and admired, till they grew so big
and bold that, like other young creatures, their pranks
made mischief as well as fun.</p>

<p>Tom would steal all the good things he could lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
his paws on in kitchen or dining-room, and cook declared
she couldn't have the rascal loose; for whole
pans of milk vanished, sheets of ginger-bread were
found in his den under the back steps, and nearly
every day he was seen scrambling off with booty of
some sort, while the fat cook waddled after, scolding
and shaking the poker at him, to the great amusement
of the boarders on the piazza. People bore with him
a long time; but when he took a lively trot down the
middle of the long dinner-table one day, after eating
all he liked, and smashing right and left as he scampered
off, with a terrible clatter of silver, glass, and
china, his angry master declared he wouldn't have
such doings, and chained him to a post on the lawn.
Here he tugged and growled dismally, while good little
Jerry frisked gayly about, trying to understand what
it all meant.</p>

<p>But presently <i>his</i> besetting sin got <i>him</i> into trouble
likewise. He loved to climb, and was never happier
than when scrambling up the rough posts of the back
piazza to bask in the sun on the roof above, peeping
down with his sharp little eyes at the children, who
could not follow. He roosted in trees like a fat brown
bird, and came tumbling down unexpectedly on lovers
who sought quiet nooks to be romantic in. He explored
the chimneys and threw into them any trifle
he happened to find,&mdash;being a rogue, and fond of
stealing hats, balls, dolls, or any small article that
came in his way. But the fun he liked best was to
climb in at the chamber windows and doze on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
soft beds; for Jerry was a luxurious fellow and scorned
the straw of his own den. This habit annoyed people
much, and the poor bear often came bundling out of
windows, with old gentlemen whacking him with canes,
or ladies throwing water after him.</p>

<p>One evening, when there was a dance and every one
was busy down stairs, Jerry took a walk on the roof,
and being sleepy, looked about for a cosey bed to take
a nap in. Two brothers occupied one of these rooms,
and both were Jerry's good friends, especially the
younger. Georgie was fast asleep, as his dancing days
had not yet begun, and Charlie was waltzing away
down stairs; so Jerry crept into bed and nestled down
beside his playmate, who was too sleepy to do anything
but roll over, thinking the big brother had come to
bed.</p>

<p>By and by Charlie did come up, late and tired, and
having forgotten a lamp, undressed in the moonlight,
observing nothing till about to step into bed; then,
finding something rolled up in the clothes, thought it
a joke of the other boys, caught up a racket and began
to bang away at the suspicious bundle. A scene of
wild confusion followed, for Jerry growled and clawed
and couldn't get out; Georgie woke, and thinking
his bed-fellow was his brother being abused by some
frolicsome mate, held on to Jerry, defending him
bravely, till a rent in the sheet allowed a shaggy head
to appear, so close to his own that the poor child was
painfully reminded of Red Riding Hood's false grandmother.
Charlie was speechless with laughter at this
discovery, and while Jerry bounced about the bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
snarling and hugging pillows as he tried to get free,
terrified Georgie rushed down the hall screaming,
"The wolf! the wolf!" till he took refuge in his
mother's room.</p>

<p>Out popped night-capped heads, anxious voices cried,
"Is it fire?" and in a moment the house was astir.
The panic might have been serious if Jerry had not
come galloping down stairs, hotly pursued by Charlie
in his night-gown, still belaboring the poor beast, and
howling, "He was in my bed! He scared George!
I'll thrash him!"</p>

<p>Then the alarmed ladies and gentlemen laughed
and grew calm, while the boys all turned out and
hunted Jerry up stairs and down, till he was captured
and ignominiously lugged away to be tied in the
barn.</p>

<p>That prank sealed his fate, and he went to join his
brother in captivity. Here they lived for a year, and
went to housekeeping in a den in the bank, with a
trough for their food, and a high, knotted pole to
climb on. They had many visitors, and learned a few
tricks, but were not happy bears; for they longed to
be free, and the older they grew, the more they sighed
for the great forest where they were born.</p>

<p>The second summer something happened that parted
them forever. Among the children that year were
Fred and Fan Howard, two jolly young persons of
twelve and fourteen. Of course the bears were very
interesting, and Fred tried their tempers by tormenting
them, while Fan won their hearts with cake and
nuts, candy and caresses. Tom was Fred's favorite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and Jerry was Fan's. Tom was very intelligent, and
covered himself with glory by various exploits. One
was taking off the boards which roofed the den, so
that the sun should dry the dampness after a rain;
and he carefully replaced them at night. Any dog
who approached the trough got his ears smartly
boxed, and meddlesome boys were hugged till they
howled for mercy. He danced in a way to convulse
the soberest, and Fred taught him to shoulder arms
in such a funny imitation of a stout old soldier of
the town that the children rolled on the grass in fits
of laughter when the cap was on, and the wooden
gun flourished at word of command by the clumsy
hero.</p>

<p>Jerry had no accomplishments, but his sweet temper
made many friends. He let the doves eat with
him, the kittens frolic all over his broad back, and
was never rough with the small people who timidly
offered the buns he took so gently from their little
hands. But he pined in captivity, refused his food,
and lay in his den all day, or climbed to the top of
the pole and sat there looking off to the cool, dark
forest, with such a pensive air that Fan said it made
her heart ache to see him. Just before the season
ended, Jerry disappeared. No one could imagine how
the chain broke, but gone he was, and never came
back, to Fan's satisfaction and Tom's great sorrow.
He mourned for his brother, and Mr. Hitchcock
began to talk of killing him; for it would not do to let
two bears loose in the neighborhood, as they sometimes
killed sheep and did much harm.</p>

<p>"I wish my father would buy him," said Fred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
"I've always wanted a menagerie, and a tame bear
would be a capital beginning."</p>

<p>"I'll ask him, for I hate to have the poor old
fellow killed," answered Fan. She not only begged
papa to buy Tom, but confessed that she filed Jerry's
chain and helped him to escape.</p>

<p>"I know it was wrong, but I couldn't see him
suffer," she said. "Now if you buy Tom I'll give
you my five dollars to help, and Mr. Hitchcock will
forgive me and be glad to get rid of both the bears."</p>

<p>After some consultation Tom <i>was</i> bought, and
orders were sent to have a house built for him in a
sunny corner of the garden, with strong rings to chain
him to, and a good lock on the door to keep him in.
When he was settled in these new quarters he held
daily receptions for some weeks. Young and old
came to see him, and Fred showed off his menagerie
with the pride of a budding Barnum. A bare spot
was soon worn on the grass where Tom's parade
ground was, and at all hours the poor fellow might be
seen dancing and drilling, or sitting at his door,
thoughtfully surveying the curious crowd, and privately
wishing he never had been born.</p>

<p>Here he lived for another year, getting so big that
he could hardly turn round in his house, and so cross
that Fred began to be a little afraid of him after
several hugs much too close to be safe or agreeable.
One morning the door of the house was found broken
off, and Tom gone. Fred was rather relieved; but
his father was anxious, and ordered out the boys of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
neighborhood to find the runaway, lest he should
alarm people or do some harm. It was an easy matter
to trace him, for more than one terrified woman
had seen the big, brown beast sniffing round her back
premises after food; a whole schoolful of children had
been startled out of their wits by a bear's head at the
window; and one old farmer was in a towering rage
over the damage done to his bee-hives and garden patch
by "the pesky critter, afore he took to the woods."</p>

<p>After a long tramp poor Tom was found rolled up
in a sunny nook, resting after a glorious frolic. He
went home without much reluctance, but from that
time it was hard to keep him. Bolts and bars, chains
and ropes were of little use; for when the longing
came, off he went, on one occasion carrying the house
on his back, like a snail, till he tipped it over and
broke loose. Fred was quite worn out with his pranks,
and tried to sell or give him away; but nobody would
buy or accept such a troublesome pet. Even tender
hearted Fan gave him up, when he frightened a little
child into a fit and killed some sheep, in his last
holiday.</p>

<p>It was decided that he must be killed, and a party
of men, armed with guns, set out to carry the sentence
into effect. Fred went also to see that all was properly
done, and Fanny called after him with tears in
her eyes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Say good by for me, and kill him as kindly as
you can."</p>

<p>This time Tom had been gone a week and had
evidently made up his mind to be a free bear; for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
had wandered far into the deepest wood and made a
den for himself among the rocks. Here they found
him, but could not persuade him to come out, and no
bold Putnam was in the troop, to creep in and conquer
him there.</p>

<p>"Bullets will reach him if we can't, so blaze away,
boys, and finish him off. We have fooled away time
enough, and I want to get home to supper," said the
leader of the hunt, after many attempts had been
made to lure or drive Tom from his shelter.</p>

<p>So they "blazed away," and growls of pain proved
that some of the bullets had hit. But Tom would
not budge, and having used up their ammunition, the
disappointed hunters went home resolving to bring
dogs next day and finish the job. They were spared
the trouble, however, for when Fred looked from his
window in the morning he saw that Tom had returned,
and ran down to welcome the rebel back. But one
look at the poor beast showed him that he had only
come home to die; for he was covered with wounds
and lay moaning on his bed of straw, looking as pathetic
as a bear could, his shaggy coat full of burrs, his
head and breast full of shot, and one paw apparently
broken.</p>

<p>Fanny cried over him, and Fred was quite bowed
down with remorse; but nothing could be done, and
soon, with a vain effort to lick the hands that
stroked him, poor Tom lifted his great paw for a
farewell shake, and died, with his great head on
his master's knee, in token of forgiveness. As if to
atone for their seeming cruelty, Fanny hung the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
little house with black while Tom lay in state, and
Fred, resisting all temptations to keep his fine skin,
buried him like a warrior "with his martial cloak
around him," in the green woods he loved so well.</p>


<div class='center'>II. <span class="smcap">Boys.</span></div>

<p>The next tenants of the little house were three riotous
lads,&mdash;for Fred's family moved away,&mdash;and the
new comers took possession one fine spring day with
great rejoicing over this ready-made plaything. They
were queer fellows, of eleven, twelve, and fourteen; for,
having read the "Boys' Froissart" and other warlike
works, they were quite carried away by these stirring
tales, and each boy was a hero. Harry, the eldest, was
Henry of Navarre, and wore a white plume on every
occasion. Ned was the Black Prince, and clanked in
tin armor, while little Billy was William Tell and
William Wallace by turns.</p>

<p>Tom's deserted mansion underwent astonishing
changes about this time. Bows and arrows hung on
its walls; battle-axes, lances, and guns stood in the
corners; helmets, shields, and all manner of strange
weapons adorned the rafters; cannon peeped from its
port-holes; a drawbridge swung over the moat that
soon surrounded it; the flags of all nations waved from
its roof, and the small house was by turns an armory,
a fort, a castle, a robber's cave, a warrior's tomb, a wigwam,
and the Bastile.</p>

<p>The neighbors were both amused and scandalized
by the pranks of these dramatic young persons; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
they enacted with much spirit and skill all the historical
events which pleased their fancy, and speedily enlisted
other boys to join in the new plays. At one
time, painted and be-feathered Indians whooped about
the garden, tomahawking the unhappy settlers in the
most dreadful manner. At another, Achilles, radiant
in a tin helmet and boiler-cover shield, dragged Hector
at the tail of his chariot (the wheel-barrow), drawn by
two antic and antique steeds, who upset both victor
and vanquished before the fun was over. Tell shot
bushels of apples off the head of the stuffed suit of
clothes that acted his son, C&oelig;ur de Leon and Saladin
hacked blocks and cut cushions <i> la</i> Walter Scott, and
tournaments of great splendor were held on the grass,
in which knights from all ages, climes, and races, tilted
gallantly, while fair dames of tender years sat upon
the wood-pile to play Queens of Beauty and award the
prize of valor.</p>

<p>Nor were more modern heroes forgotten. Napoleon
crossed the Alps (a muck heap, high fence, and prickly
hedge), with intrepid courage. Wellington won many
a Waterloo in the melon patch, and Washington glorified
every corner of the garden by his heroic exploits.
Grant smoked sweet-fern cigars at the fall of Richmond;
Sherman marched victoriously to Georgia through the
corn and round the tomato bed, and Phil Sheridan
electrified the neighborhood by tearing down the road
on a much-enduring donkey, stung to unusual agility
by matches tied to his tail.</p>

<p>It grew to be an almost daily question among the
young people, "What are the Morton boys at now?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
for these interesting youths were much admired by
their mates, who eagerly manned the fences to behold
the revels, when scouts brought word of a new play
going on. Mrs. Morton believed in making boys happy
at home, and so allowed them entire liberty in the
great garden, as it was safer than river, streets, or ball-ground,
where a very mixed crowd was to be found.
Here they were under her own eye, and the safe, sweet
tie between them still held fast; for she was never too
busy to bind up their wounds after a fray, wave her
handkerchief when cheers told of victory, rummage
her stores for costumes, or join in their eager study of
favorite heroes when rain put an end to their out-of-door
fun.</p>

<p>So the summer was a lively one, and though the
vegetables suffered some damage, a good crop of
healthy, happy hours was harvested, and all were
satisfied. The little house looked much the worse for
the raids made upon it, but still stood firm with the
stars and stripes waving over it, and peace seemed to
reign one October afternoon as the boys lay under the
trees eating apples and planning what to play next.</p>

<p>"Bobby wants to be a knight of the Round Table.
We might take him in and have fun with the rites,
and make him keep a vigil and all that," proposed
William Wallace, anxious to admit his chosen friend
to the inner circle of the brotherhood.</p>

<p>"He's such a little chap he'd be scared and howl.
I don't vote for that," said the Black Prince, rather
scornfully, as he lay with his kingly legs in the air,
and his royal mouth full of apple.</p>

<p>"I do!" declared Henry of Navarre, always generous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and amiable. "Bob is a plucky little chap, and
will do anything we put him to. He's poor and the
other fellows look down on him, so that's another reason
why we ought to take him in and stand by him.
Let's give him a good trial, and if he's brave, we'll
have him."</p>

<p>"So we will! Let's do it now; he's over there
waiting to be asked in. <i>He</i> doesn't go poking his nose
where he isn't wanted, as some folks do," cried Billy,
who had often been snubbed by the big boys in his
efforts at knightly feats.</p>

<p>A whistle brought Bobby, with a beaming face, for
he burned to join the fun, but held back because he
was not a gentleman's son. A sturdy, honest little
soul was Bobby, true as steel, brave as a lion, and
loyal as an old-time vassal to his young lord, kind
Billy, who always told him all the plans, explained the
mysteries, and shared the goodies when feasts were
spread.</p>

<p>Now he stood leaning against one of the posts of
the little house whither the boys had adjourned, and
listened bashfully while Harry told him what he must
do to join the heroes of the Round Table. He did
not understand half of it, but was ready for any trial,
and took the comical oath administered to him with
the utmost solemnity.</p>

<p>"You must stay here locked in for some hours, and
watch your armor. That's the vigil young knights
had to keep before they could fight. You mustn't
be scared at any noises you hear, or anything you see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
or sing out for help, even if you stay here till dark.
You'll be a coward if you do, and never have a
sword."</p>

<p>"I promise truly; hope to die if I don't!" answered
Bobby, fixing his blue eyes on the speaker, and holding
his curly head erect with the air of one ready to face
any peril; for the desire of his soul was to own a
sword, like Billy, and clash it on warlike occasions.</p>

<p>Then a suit of armor was piled up on the red box,
which was by turns altar, table, tomb, and executioner's
block. Banners were hung over it, the place darkened,
two candles lighted, and after certain rites which
cannot be divulged, the little knight was left to his
vigil with the door locked.</p>

<p>The boys howled outside, smote on the roof, fired a
cannon, and taunted the prisoner with derisive epithets
to stir him to wrath. But no cry answered them, no
hint of weariness, fear, or anger betrayed him, and
after a half-hour of this sort of fun, they left him to
the greater trial of silence, solitude, and uncertainty.</p>

<p>The short afternoon was soon gone, and the tea bell
rang before the vigil had lasted long enough.</p>

<p>"He won't know what time it is; let's leave him till
after supper, and then march out with torches and
bring him in to a good feed. Mother won't mind, and
Hetty likes to stuff fellows," proposed Harry, and all
being hungry, the first part of the plan was carried
out at once.</p>

<p>But before tea was over, the unusual clang of the
fire bells drove all thought of Bobby out of the boys'
minds, as they raced away to the exciting scene, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
take their share in the shouting, running, and tumbling
about in every one's way.</p>

<p>The great hotel was burning, and till midnight the
town was in an uproar. No lives were lost, but much
property, and nothing else was thought of till dawn.
A heavy shower did good service, and about one o'clock,
people began to go home tired out. Mrs. Morton and
other ladies were too busy giving shelter to the people
from the hotel, and making coffee for the firemen, to
send their boys to bed. In fact, they could not catch
them; for the youngsters were wild with excitement,
and pervaded the place like will-o'-the-wisps, running
errands, lugging furniture, splashing about with water,
and howling till they were as hoarse as crows.</p>

<p>"This is the battle of Beauvais, and we've set the
city a-fire by flinging pitch-pots over the walls,"
croaked Harry to Ned as they bumped against each
other, one carrying a great coffee-pot and the other a
feather-bed.</p>

<p>"No, it's the fall of Troy, and I'm neas lugging
off the old man," panted Ned, staggering away with
the heavy load on his back.</p>

<p>At last the flurry was over, and our three lads, very
dirty, wet, and tired, went to bed and to sleep, and
never once thought of poor Bobby, till next morning.
Then Harry suddenly rose up, with an exclamation
that effectually roused both his brothers.</p>

<p>"By St. Dennis, we've left that boy there all night!"</p>

<p>"He wouldn't be such a fool as to stay; that old
lock's broken easy enough," said Ned, looking
troubled, in spite of his words.</p>

<p>"Yes, he would! He promised, and he'll keep his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
word like a true knight. It rained and was cold, and
no one knew where he was. Oh dear, I hope he isn't
dead," cried Billy, tumbling out of bed and into his
clothes as fast as he could.</p>

<p>The others laughed, but dressed with unusual
speed, and flew to the garden house, to find the
lock unbroken, and all as still inside as when they left
it. Looking very anxious, Harry opened the door and
all peeped in. There, at his post before the altar, lay
the little knight fast asleep. Rain had soaked his
clothes, the chilly night air made his lips and hands
purple with cold, and the trials of those long hours
left the round cheeks rather pale. But he still
guarded his arms, and at the first sound was awake
and ready to defend them, though somewhat shaky
with sleep and stiffness.</p>

<p>The penitent boys poured forth apologies, in which
fire, remorse, and breakfast were oddly mixed. Bobby
forgave them like a gentleman, only saying, with a
laugh and a shiver, "Guess I'd better go home, ma'll
be worried about me. If I'd known being out all
night and getting wet was part of the business, I'd 'a'
left word and brought a blanket. Be I a Round Table
now? Shall I have a sword, and train with the rest?
I didn't holler once, and wasn't much scared, for all
the bells, and the dark, and the rain."</p>

<p>"You've won your spurs, and we'll knight you just
as soon as we get time. You're a brave fellow, and
I'm proud to have you one of my men. Please don't
say much about this; we'll make it all right, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
we're awfully sorry," answered Harry, while Ned put
his own jacket over the wet shoulders, and Billy
beamed at him, feeling that his friend's exploit outdid
any of his own.</p>

<p>Bobby marched away as proudly as if he already
saw the banners waving over him, and felt the accolade
that made him a true knight. But that happy
moment was delayed for some time, because the cold
caught in that shower threatened a fit of sickness;
and the boys' play looked as if it might end in sad
earnest.</p>

<p>Harry and his brothers confessed all to mamma,
listened with humility to her lecture on true knighthood,
and did penance by serving Bobby like real
brothers-in-arms, while he was ill. As soon as the
hardy boy was all right again, they took solemn counsel
together how they should reward him, and atone
for their carelessness. Many plans were discussed, but
none seemed fine enough for this occasion till Billy
had a bright idea.</p>

<p>"Let's buy Bob some hens. He wants some dreadfully,
and we ought to do something grand after treating
him so badly, and nearly killing him."</p>

<p>"Who's got any money? I haven't; but it's a
good idea," responded Ned, vainly groping in all his
pockets for a cent to head the subscription with.</p>

<p>"Mamma would lend us some, and we could work
to pay for it," began Billy.</p>

<p>"No, I've a better plan," interrupted Harry with
authority. "We ought to make a sacrifice and suffer
for our sins. We will have an auction and sell our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
arms. The boys want them, and will pay well. My
lords and gentlemen, what say ye?"</p>

<p>"We will!" responded the loyal subjects of King
Henry.</p>

<p>"Winter is coming, and we can't use them," said
Billy, innocently.</p>

<p>"And by next spring we shall be too old for such
games," added Ned.</p>

<p>"'Tis well! Ho! call hither my men. Bring out
the suits of mail; sound the trumpets, and set on!"
thundered Harry, striking an attitude, and issuing his
commands with royal brevity.</p>

<p>A funny scene ensued; for while Billy ran to collect
the boys, Ned dismantled the armory, and Hal disposed
of the weapons in the most effective manner, on
trees, fences, and grass, where the bidders could examine
and choose at their ease. Their mates had
always admired and coveted these war-like treasures,
for some were real, and others ingenious imitations; so
they gladly came at sound of the hunter's horn which
was blown when Robin Hood wanted his merry men.</p>

<p>Harry was auctioneer, and rattled off the most
amazing medley of nonsense in praise of the articles,
which he rapidly knocked down to the highest bidder.
The competition was lively, for the boys laughed so
much they hardly knew what they were doing, and
made the rashest offers; but they all knew what the
money was to be used for, so they paid their bills
handsomely, and marched off with cross-bows, old
guns, rusty swords, and tin armor, quite contented
with their bargains.</p>

<p>Seven dollars was realized by the sale, and a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
rooster and several hens solemnly presented to Bobby,
who was overwhelmed by this unexpected atonement,
and immediately established his fowls in the wood-shed,
where they happily resided through the winter,
and laid eggs with such gratifying rapidity that he
earned quite a little fortune, and insisted on saying
that his vigil had not only made a knight of him, but
a millionnaire.</p>


<div class='center'>III. <span class="smcap">Babies.</span></div>

<p>The little house stood empty till spring; then a
great stir went on in the garden, getting it ready for a
new occupant. It was mended, painted red, fitted up
with a small table and chairs, and a swing. Sunflowers
stood sentinel at the door, vines ran over it,
and little beds of flowers were planted on either side.
Paths were dug all round the lawn, and a baby-carriage
was rolled up and down to harden them. The
neighbors wondered what was coming next, and one
June day they found out; for a procession appeared,
escorting the new tenant to the red mansion, with
great rejoicing among the boys.</p>

<p>First came Billy blowing the horn, then Ned waving
their best banner, then Hal drawing the baby wagon,
in which, as on a throne, sat the little cousin who had
come to spend the summer, and rule over them like a
small, sweet tyrant. A very sprightly damsel was four-year-old
Queenie, blue-eyed, plump, and rosy, with
a cloud of yellow curls, chubby arms that embraced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
every one, and a pair of stout legs that trotted all day.
She surveyed her kingdom with cries of delight, and
took possession of "mine tottage" at once, beginning
housekeeping by a tumble out of the swing, a header
into the red chest, and a pinch in the leaf of the table.
But she won great praise from the boys by making
light of these mishaps, and came up smiling, with a
bump on her brow, a scratch on her pug nose, and a
bruise on one fat finger, and turned out tea for the
gentlemen as if she had done it all her life; for the table
was set, and all manner of tiny cakes and rolls
stood ready to welcome her.</p>

<p>This was only the beginning of tea parties; for very
soon a flock of lovely little friends came to play with
Queenie, and such pretty revels went on it seemed as
if fairies had taken possession of the small house. Dolls
had picnics, kittens went a-visiting, tin carts rattled up
and down, gay balloons flew about, pigmy soldiers toddled
round the paths in paper caps, and best of all, rosy
little girls danced on the grass, picked the flowers, chased
butterflies, and sang as blithely as the birds. Queenie
took the lead in these frolics, and got into no end of
scrapes by her love of exploration,&mdash;often leading her
small friends into the strawberry-bed, down the road,
over the wall, or to some neighbor's house, coolly demanding
"a dint a water and dingerbed for all us
ones."</p>

<p>Guards were set, bars and locks put up, orders given,
and punishments inflicted, but all in vain; the dauntless
baby always managed to escape, and after anxious
hunts and domestic flurries, would be found up a tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
under the big rhubarb leaves, in a hen house, or calmly
strolling to town without her hat. All sorts of people
took her to drive at her request, and brought her back
just as her agitated relatives were flying to the river in
despair. Once she departed with a flock of sheep, and
was returned so dirty no one knew her till she was
scrubbed. Another time, she passed the morning in
the pig-pen, having fallen over the fence; and finding
pleasant society in a dozen young piggies, stayed to
play with them till discovered among the straw, surrounded
by her new friends, one of whom slept sweetly
in her arms.</p>

<p>"We must tie her up," said Mrs. Morton, quite worn
out with her pranks.</p>

<p>So a strong cord was put round Queenie's waist, and
fastened to one of the rings in the little house where
Tom used to be chained. At first she raged and tugged,
then submitted, and played about as if she didn't care;
but she laid plans in her naughty little mind, and carried
them out, to the great dismay of Bessie, the maid.</p>

<p>"I want to tut drass," she said in her most persuasive
tones.</p>

<p>So Bessie gave her the rusty scissors she was allowed
to use, and let her play make hay till her toy wagon
was full.</p>

<p>"I want a dint a water, pease," was the next request,
and Bessie went in to get it. She was delayed a few
moments, and when she came out no sign of Queenie
remained but a pile of yellow hair cut off in a hurry,
and the end of the cord. Slyboots was gone, scissors
and all.</p>

<p>Then there was racing and calling, scolding and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
wailing, but no Queenie was to be seen anywhere on
the premises. Poor Bessie ran one way, Aunt Morton
another, and Billy, who happened to be at home,
poked into all the nooks and corners for the runaway.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and things began to look serious,
when Harry came in much excited, and laughing so he
could hardly speak.</p>

<p>"Where <i>do</i> you think that dreadful baby has turned
up? Over at Pat Floyd's. He found her in the water
pipes. You know a lot of those big ones are lying in
the back street ready to use as soon as the place is dug.
Well, that little rascal crept in, and then couldn't turn
round, so she went on till she came out by Pat's house,
and nearly scared him out of his wits. The pipes were
not joined, so she had light and air, but I guess she had
a hard road to travel. Such a hot, dirty, tired baby
you never saw. Mrs. Floyd is washing her up. You'd
better go and get her, Bess."</p>

<p>Bess went and returned with naughty Queenie, looking
as if rats had gnawed her curls off, and the sand of
the great desert had been ground into her hands and
knees,&mdash;not to mention the iron rust that ruined her
pretty pink frock, or the crown of her hat rubbed to
rags.</p>

<p>"I wasn't frighted. You said Dod be'd all wound,
so I goed wite alon, and Mis Foyd gived me a nice cold
tater, and a tootie, and the bid dord washed my hands
wif his wed tun."</p>

<p>That was Queenie's account of the matter, but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
behaved so well after it that her friends suspected the
perilous prank had made a good impression upon her.</p>

<p>To keep her at home she was set to farming, and the
little house was a barn. In it lived a rocking horse,
several wooden cows, woolly sheep, cats and dogs, as
well as a queer collection of carts and carriages, tools
and baskets. Every day the busy little farmer dug
and hoed, planted and watered her "dardin," made
hay, harvested vegetables, picked fruit, or took care of
animals,&mdash;pausing now and then to ride her horse, drive
out in her phaeton, or go to an imaginary fire with the
engine Billy had made for her.</p>

<p>The little friends came to help her, and the flower-beds
soon looked as if an earthquake had upheaved
them; for things were planted upside down, holes dug,
stones piled, and potatoes laid about as if expected to
dig themselves. But cheeks bloomed like roses, small
hands got brown, and busy feet trotted firmly about
the paths, while the red barn echoed with the gayest
laughter all day long.</p>

<p>On Queenie's fifth birthday, in September, she had a
gipsy party, and all the small neighbors came to it.
A tent was pitched, three tall poles held up a kettle
over a "truly fire" that made the water really boil, and
supper was spread on the grass. The little girls wore
red and blue petticoats, gay shawls or cloaks, bright
handkerchiefs on their heads, and as many beads and
breastpins as they liked. Some had tamborines, and
shook them as they danced; one carried a dolly in the
hood of her cloak like a true gypsy, and all sung,
skipping hand in hand round the fire.</p>

<p>The mammas looked on and helped about supper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and Bess sat in the tent like an old woman, and told
pleasant fortunes, as she looked in the palms of the soft
little hands the children showed her.</p>

<p>They had a charming time, and all remembered it
well; for that night, when the fun was over, every one
in bed, and the world asleep, a great storm came on;
the wind blew a gale and chimney tops flew off, blinds
banged, trees were broken, apples whisked from the
boughs by the bushel, and much mischief was done. But
worst of all, the dear little house blew away! The
roof went in one direction, the boards in another, the
poor horse lay heels up, and the rest of the animals
were scattered far and wide over the garden.</p>

<p>Great was the lamentation next morning, when the
children saw the ruin. The boys felt that it was past
mending, and gave it up; while Queenie consoled herself
for the devastation of her farm by the childish belief
that a crop of new cats and dogs, cows and horses,
would come up in the spring from the seed sowed broadcast
by the storm.</p>

<p>So that was the sad end of the little house in the
garden.<br /></p>

<p>"Plenty of time for another. Let the little folks
go to bed, now they've had their story, and please go
on, auntie," cried Min, when all had listened with
more interest than they would confess to the children's
tale.</p>

<p>So the small people trotted off, much against their
will, and this most obliging of aunts drew forth
another manuscript, saying, as she glanced at several
of her elder nieces, brave in the new trinkets Santa
Claus had sent them:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is a story with a moral to it, which the girls
will understand; the boys can take naps while I read,
for it won't interest them."</p>

<p>"If it shows up the girls we shall like it," answered
Geoff, and composed himself to hear and enjoy</p>


<h4>DAISY'S JEWEL-BOX, AND HOW SHE
FILLED IT.</h4>

<p>"It would be perfectly splendid, and just what I
long for, but I don't see how I <i>can</i> go with nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
fit to wear," said Daisy, looking up from the letter in
her hand, with a face full of girlish eagerness and
anxiety.</p>

<p>Mrs. Field set every fear at rest with a reassuring
smile, as she quietly made one of the sacrifices mothers
think so small, when made for the dear creatures for
whom they live.</p>

<p>"You shall go, dear; I have a little sum put by
for an emergency. Twenty-five dollars will do a good
deal, when tastes are simple and we do our own dressmaking."</p>

<p>"But mother, that was for your cloak. You need
it so much I can't bear to have you give it up," said
sober little Jane, the home-girl, who never cared for
visiting like her gay elder sister.</p>

<p>"Hush, dear; I can do very well with a shawl over
my old sack. Don't say a word to spoil Daisy's
pleasure. She needs a change after this dull autumn,
and must be neat and nice."</p>

<p>Janey said no more, and fell to thinking what she
had to offer Daisy; for both took great pride in the
pretty girl, who was the queen among her young
friends.</p>

<p>Daisy heard, but was so busy re-reading the letter
that she took no notice then, though she recalled the
words later.</p>

<p>"Come and pass the holidays with us. We all
want to see you, and Laura begs you will not disappoint
her."</p>

<p>This was the invitation that came from Laura's
mother; for the two girls had struck up a great friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
during the summer the city family passed in the
little country town where Daisy lived. She had
ardently hoped that Laura would not forget the
charming plan, and now the cordial message came,
just when the season would be gayest in town.</p>

<p>"I suppose I must have the everlasting white
muslin for a party dress, as that is the cheapest thing
a girl can wear. A nun's-veiling is what I long for,
but I'm afraid we can't afford it," she said with a
sigh, coming back from visions of city delights to the
all-important question of dress.</p>

<p>"Yes, you can, and new ribbons, gloves, and slippers
as well. You are so small it doesn't take much, and
we can make it right up ourselves. So run and collect
all your little finery, while I go and do the shopping
at once."</p>

<p>"You dearest of mothers! how you always manage
to give me what I want, and smooth all my worries
away. I'll be as good as gold, and bring you the best
present I can find."</p>

<p>Daisy's grateful kiss warmed the dear woman's
heart, and made her forget how shabby the old sack
was, as she trudged away to spend the money carefully
hoarded for the much needed cloak.</p>

<p>Needles and fingers flew, and two days before Christmas,
Daisy set out for the enchanted city, feeling very
rich with the pretty new dress in her trunk, and five
dollars for pocket money. It seemed a large sum to the
country girl, and she planned to spend it all in gifts
for mother and Janey, whose tired faces rather haunted
her after she had caught the last glimpse of them.</p>

<p>Her reception was a warm one, for all the Vaughns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
were interested in the blooming little creature they
had found among the hills, and did their best to make
her visit a pleasant one. The first day she was in a
delightful sort of maze, things were so splendid, gay
and new; the second she felt awkward and countrified,
and wished she had not come. A letter from her
mother on Christmas morning did her good, and gave
her courage to bear the little trials that afflicted her.</p>

<p>"My clothes do look dowdy beside Laura's elegant
costumes, though they did seem very nice at home;
but my hair isn't red, and that's a comfort," she said
to herself, as she dressed for the party that evening.</p>

<p>She could not help smiling at the bonny figure she
saw in the long mirror, and wishing mother and Janey
could see the work of their hands in all its glory; for
the simple white dress was most becoming, and her
kind host had supplied her with lovely flowers for
bosom and bouquet.</p>

<p>But the smile died as she took up her one ornament,
an antique necklace, given her by an old aunt. At
home it was considered a very rare and beautiful
thing, and Daisy had been rather proud of her rococo
chain till she saw Laura's collection of trinkets, the
variety and brilliancy of which dazzled her eyes, and
woke a burning desire to possess treasures of the same
sort. It was some consolation to find that the most
striking were not very expensive, and after poring over
them with deep interest, Daisy privately resolved to buy
as many as her five dollars would compass. These new
ornaments could be worn during her visit, and serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
as gifts when she went home; so the extravagance
would not be so great as it seemed.</p>

<p>This purpose comforted her, as she put on the old
necklace, which looked very dingy beside the Rhinestones
that flashed, the silver bangles that clashed,
and the gilded butterflies, spiders, arrows, flowers, and
daggers that shone on the young girls whom she met
that evening. Their fine dresses she could not hope
to imitate, but a pin and a pair of bracelets were
possible, and she resolved to have them, if she had to
borrow money to get home with.</p>

<p>Her head was quite turned by this desire for the
cheap trinkets which attract all feminine eyes now-a-days,
and when, among the pretty things that came
to her from the Christmas tree that night, she received
a blue plush jewel-box, she felt that it was almost
a duty to fill it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a beauty? I never had one, and it is just
what I wanted," said Daisy, delightedly lifting the
tray full of satin beds for pretty things, and pulling
out the little drawer underneath, where the giver's
card lay.</p>

<p>"I told papa a work-box or a fan would be better;
but he liked this and would buy it," explained Laura,
who knew how useless it was to her friend.</p>

<p>"It was very kind of him, and I prefer it to either
of those. I've nothing but my old chain and a shabby
little pin to put in it now, but I'll fill it in time,"
answered Daisy, whose eyes seemed to behold the
unbought treasures already reposing on the dainty
cushion.</p>

<p>"Real jewels are the best, my dear, for their worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and beauty are never lost. The tinsel girls wear now
is poor stuff, and money is thrown away in buying it,"
said Mrs. Vaughn, who overheard them and guessed
the temptation which beset the little country girl.</p>

<p>Daisy looked conscious, but answered, with a smile,
and a hand on her necklace, "This old thing wouldn't
look well in my pretty box, so I'll leave it empty till
I can afford something better."</p>

<p>"But that antique chain is worth many mock
diamonds; for it is genuine, and its age adds to its
value. Lovers of such things would pay a good price
for that and keep it carefully. So don't be ashamed
of it, my dear,&mdash;though this pretty throat needs no
ornament," added Mrs. Vaughn, hoping the girl would
not forget the little lesson she was trying to give her.</p>

<p>Daisy did not, but when she went to bed, set the
jewel-box on the table where it would meet her eyes
the first thing in the morning, and then fell asleep
trying to decide that she would buy no baubles, since
there were better things to spend her money on.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said; but as the two girls went
about the gay street on various pleasant errands,
Daisy never could pass the jewellers' windows without
stopping to gloat over the trays full of enchanting
ornaments. More than once, when alone, she went in
to inquire the prices of these much coveted trifles, and
their cheapness made the temptation harder to resist.
Certain things had a sort of fascination for her, and
seemed to haunt her in an uncanny way, giving her no
peace till she would decide to buy them. A golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
rose with a diamond drop of dew on its leaves got into
her very dreams; an enamelled butterfly flew before
her as she walked, and a pair of silver bangles rattled
in her ear like goblin castanets.</p>

<p>"I shall not be safe till I spend that money, so I
might as well decide on something and be at peace,"
said poor Daisy, after some days of this girlish struggle;
"I needn't buy anything for mother and Janey,
for I can share my nice and useful presents with
them; but I should like to be able to show the girls
my lovely jewel-box with something pretty in it, and
I will! Laura needn't know anything about it, for
I'm sure she'd think it silly, and so would her mother.
I'll slip in now and buy that rose; it's only three
dollars, and the other two will get one porte-bonheur,
or the dear butterfly."</p>

<p>Making her way through the crowd that always
stood before the brilliant window, Daisy went in and
demanded the rose; then, rather scared by this reckless
act she paused, and decided to look farther before
buying anything else. With a pleasant little flutter
of the heart as the pretty trinket was done up, she put
her hand into her pocket to pay for it, and all the
color died out of her cheeks when she found no purse
there. In vain she pulled out handkerchief, keys, and
pincushion; no sign of money was found but a ten-cent
piece which had fallen out at some time. She
looked so pale and dismayed that the shopman guessed
her misfortune before she told it, but all the comfort
he offered was the useless information that the
crowded corner was a great place for pick-pockets.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done but to return the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
rose and go sadly home, feeling that fate was very
cruel to snatch away this long-coveted happiness when
so nearly won. Like the milk-maid who upset her
pail while planning which ribbons would become her
best, poor Daisy's dreams of splendor came to a sudden
end; for instead of a golden rose, she was left with
only ten cents,&mdash;and not even a purse to put it in.</p>

<p>She went home angry, disappointed, and ashamed,
but too proud to complain, though not able to keep
the loss to herself; for it was a sad affair, and her face
betrayed her in spite of her efforts to be gay.</p>

<p>"I know you were staring at the French diamonds
in that corner store. I never can get you by there
without a regular tug," cried Laura, when the tale
was very briefly told.</p>

<p>"I can't help it; I'm perfectly fascinated by those
foolish things, and I know I should have bought
some; so it is well that I've lost my money, perhaps,"
answered Daisy, looking so innocently penitent
and so frankly disappointed that Mr. Vaughn said
kindly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So it is, for now I have a chance to complete my
Christmas present. I was not sure it would suit so I
gave it empty. Please use this in buying some of the
'fascinating things' you like so well."</p>

<p>A bright ten-dollar gold piece was slipped into
Daisy's hand, and she was obliged to keep it, in spite
of all her protestations that she could live without
trinkets, and did not need it as her ticket home was
already bought.   Mrs. Vaughn added a nice little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
purse, and Laura advised her to keep the lone ten-cent
piece for a good-luck penny.</p>

<p>"Now I can do it with a free mind, and fill my box
as Mr. Vaughn wishes me to. Won't it be fun?"
thought Daisy, as she skipped up-stairs after dinner,
with a load of care lifted from her spirits.</p>

<p>Laura was taking a music lesson, so her guest went
to the sewing-room to mend the facing of her dress,
which some one had stepped on while she stood in
that fatal crowd. A seamstress was there, sewing as if
for a wager, and while Daisy stitched her braid she
wondered if there was any need of such haste; for the
young woman's fingers flew, a feverish color was in her
cheeks, and now and then she sighed as if tired or
worried.</p>

<p>"Let me help, if you are in a hurry, Miss White. I
can sew fast, and know something of dressmaking.
Please let me. I'd love to do anything for Mrs.
Vaughn, she is so kind to me," said Daisy, when her
small job was done, lingering to make the offer, though
an interesting book was waiting in her room.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I guess I can get through by dark. I
do want to finish, for my mother is sick, and needs
me as well as the money," answered the needle-woman,
pausing to give the girl a grateful smile, then
stitching away faster than ever.</p>

<p>"Then I must help. Give me that sleeve to sew
up, and rest a little. You look dreadfully tired, and
you've been working all day," insisted Daisy.</p>

<p>"That's real kind, and it would be a great help, if
you really like it," answered Miss White, with a sigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
of relief as she handed over the sleeve, and saw how
heartily and helpfully Daisy fell to work.</p>

<p>Of course they talked, for the friendly act opened
both hearts, and did both girls good. As the younger
listened to the little story of love and labor, the gold
piece burned in her pocket, and tinsel trinkets looked
very poor beside the sacrifices so sweetly made by this
good daughter for the feeble mother whose comfort
and support she was.</p>

<p>"Our landlord has raised the rent, but I can't move
now, for the cold and the worry would kill ma; so
I'm tugging away to pay the extra money, else he
will turn us out, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell Mrs. Vaughn? She helps
every one, and loves to do it."</p>

<p>"So she does, bless her! She has done a deal for
us, and that's why I can't ask for more. I won't beg
while I can work, but worry wears on me, and if I
break down what <i>will</i> become of mother?"</p>

<p>Poor Mary shook the tears out of her eyes, for daylight
was going, and she had no time to cry; but
Daisy stopped to wonder how it would seem to be in
her place, "tugging away" day after day to keep a
roof over mother. It made her heart ache to think of
it, and sent her hand to her pocket with a joyful sense
of power; for alms-giving was a new pleasure, and
Daisy felt very rich.</p>

<p>"I've had a present to-day, and I'd love dearly to
share it with you if you wouldn't mind. I shall only
waste it, so do let me send it to your mother in any
shape you like," she said in a timid, but very earnest way.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Field! I couldn't do it! you are too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
kind; I never thought of hinting"&mdash;began Mary,
quite overcome by this unexpected proposal.</p>

<p>Daisy settled the matter by running away to the
study, where Mr. Vaughn was napping, to ask him if
he would give her two fives for the gold piece.</p>

<p>"Ah! the fascination is at work, I see; and we
can't wait till Monday to buy the pretty things.
Girls will be girls, and must sow their innocent wild
oats I suppose. Here, my dear, beware of pick-pockets,
and good luck to the shopping," said the old
gentleman, as he put two crisp bills into her hands,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Pick-pockets wont get this, and I <i>know</i> my shopping
will prosper now," answered Daisy, in such a
happy tone that Mr. Vaughn wondered what plan was
in the girl's head to make her look so sweet and
glad.</p>

<p>She went slowly up-stairs looking at the two bills,
which did not seem half so precious as when in the
shape of gold.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it would be very extravagant to give
her all of it. I shall do some silly thing if I keep it.
Her boots were very thin, and she coughs, and if she is
sick it will be dreadful. Suppose I give her five for
herself, and five for her mother. I'd love to feel
rich and generous for once in my life, and give real
help."</p>

<p>The house was very still, and Daisy paused at the
head of the stairs to settle the point, little dreaming
that Mrs. Vaughn had heard the talk in the sewing-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and saw her as she stood thoughtfully staring at
the two bits of paper in her hand.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't feel ashamed if Mrs. Vaughn found
me out in this, but I should never dare to let her see
my bangles and pins, if I got them. I know she
thinks them silly, especially so for me. She said she
hoped I'd set a good example to Laura, in the way of
simplicity and industry. I liked that, and so will
mother. But then, my jewel-box! All empty, and
such a pretty thing. Oh dear, I wish I could be wise
and silly at the same time."</p>

<p>Daisy sighed, and took a few more steps, then
smiled, pulled out her purse, and taking the ten-cent
piece tossed it up, saying, "Heads, Mary; tails,
myself."</p>

<p>Up flew the bright little coin, and down it came
with the goddess of liberty uppermost.</p>

<p>"That settles it; she shall have the ten, and I'll
be content with the old chain for all my jewelry," said
Daisy aloud; and looking much relieved she skipped
away, leaving the unsuspected observer to smile at her
girlish mode of deciding the question, and to rejoice
over the generous nature unspoiled as yet.</p>

<p>She watched her young guest with new interest
during the next few days; for certain fine plans were
in her mind, and every trifle helped the decision for or
against.</p>

<p>Mary White went smiling home that night to rejoice
with her feeble mother over the help that came
so opportunely and so kindly.</p>

<p>Daisy looked as if her shopping <i>had</i> prospered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
wonderfully though the old necklace was the only ornament
she wore; and those who saw her happy face at
the merry-making thought that she needed no other.
She danced as if her feet were as light as her heart,
and enjoyed that party more than the first; for no
envy spoiled her pleasure, and a secret content brightened
all the world to her.</p>

<p>But the next day she discovered that temptation
still had power over her, and she nearly spoiled her
first self-conquest by the fall which is very apt to come
after a triumph, to show us how hard it is to stand
fast, even when small Apollyons get in our way.</p>

<p>She broke the clasp of the necklace, and Mrs.
Vaughn directed her to a person who mended such
things. The man examined it with interest, and
asked its history. Daisy very willingly told all she
knew, inquiring if it was really valuable.</p>

<p>"I'd give twenty-five dollars for it any time. I've
been trying to get one to go with a pair of earrings
I picked up, and this is just what I want. Of course
you don't care to sell it, miss?" he asked, glancing
at Daisy's simple dress and rather excited face, for
his offer almost took her breath away.</p>

<p>She was not sufficiently worldly-wise to see that the
jeweller wanted it enough to give more for it, and to
make a good bargain for herself. Twenty-five dollars
seemed a vast sum, and she only paused to collect
her wits, before she answered eagerly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>should</i> like to sell it; I've had it so long
I'm tired of it, and it's all out of fashion. Mrs.
Vaughn told me some people would be glad to get it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
because it is genuine. Do you really think it is worth
twenty-five dollars?"</p>

<p>"It's old, and I shall have to tinker it up; but it
matches the earrings so well I am willing to pay a
good price for it. Will you take the money now,
miss, or think it over and call again?" asked the man,
more respectfully, after hearing Mrs. Vaughn's name.</p>

<p>"I'll take it now, if you please, sir. I shall leave
town in a day or two, and may not have time to call
again," said Daisy, taking a half-regretful look at the
chain, as the man counted out the money.</p>

<p>Holding it fast, she went away feeling that this
unexpected fortune was a reward for the good use
she had made of her gold piece.</p>

<p>"Now I can buy some really valuable ornament,
and wear it without being ashamed. What shall it
be? No tinsel for me this time;" and she walked by
the attractive shop window with an air of lofty indifference,
for she really was getting over her first
craze for that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Feeling as if she possessed the power to buy real
diamonds, Daisy turned toward the great jewellers,
pausing now and then to look for some pretty gift for
Janey, bought with her own money.</p>

<p>"What can I get for mother? She never will own
that she needs anything, and goes shabby so I can be
nice. I could get some of those fine, thick stockings,
hers are all darns,&mdash;but they might not fit. Flannel
is useful, but it isn't a pretty present. What <i>does</i>
she need most?"</p>

<p>As Daisy stopped before a great window, full of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
manner of comfortable garments, her eye fell on a
fur-lined cloak marked "$25." It seemed to answer
her question like a voice, and as she looked at it she
heard again the words,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, mother, that money was for your cloak, and
you need it very much."</p>

<p>"Hush, dear, don't say a word to spoil Daisy's
pleasure. I can do very well with a shawl over the
old sack."</p>

<p>"How could I forget that! What a selfish girl I
am, to be thinking of jewelry, when that dear, good
mother hasn't a cloak to her back. Daisy Field, I'm
ashamed of you! Go in and buy that nice, warm one
at once, and don't let me hear of that ridiculous box
again."</p>

<p>After this little burst of remorse and self-reproach,
Daisy took another look; and prudence suggested
asking the advice of some more experienced shopper
than herself, before making so important a purchase.
As if the fates were interested in settling the matter
at once, while she stood undecided, Mary White came
down the street with a parcel of work in her hands.</p>

<p>"Just the person! The Vaughns needn't know
anything about it; and Mary is a good judge."</p>

<p>It was pleasant to see the two faces brighten as the
girls met; rather comical to watch the deep interest
with which one listened and the other explained; and
beautiful to hear the grateful eagerness in Mary's
voice, as she answered cordially:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Indeed I will! You've been so kind to my mother,
there's nothing I wouldn't be glad to do for yours."</p>

<p>So in they went, and after due consideration, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
cloak was bought and ordered home,&mdash;both girls feeling
that it was a little ceremony full of love and good
will; for Mary's time was money, yet she gave it
gladly, and Daisy's purse was left empty of all but the
good-luck penny, which was to bring still greater
happiness in unsuspected ways.</p>

<p>Another secret was put away in the empty jewel-box,
and the cloak hidden in Daisy's trunk; for she
felt shy of telling her little business transactions, lest
the Vaughns should consider her extravagant. But
the thought of mother's surprise and pleasure warmed
her heart, and made the last days of her visit the
happiest. Being a mortal girl she did give a sigh as
she tied a bit of black velvet round her white throat,
instead of the necklace, which seemed really a treasure,
now it was gone; and she looked with great disfavor
at the shabby little pin, worn where she had fondly
hoped to see the golden rose. She put a real one in its
place, and never knew that her own fresh, happy face
was as lovely; for the thought of the two mothers
made comfortable by her was better than all the
pearls and diamonds that fell from the lips of the
good girl in the fairy tale.</p>

<p>"Let me help you pack your trunk; I love to cram
things in, and dance on the lid when it won't shut,"
said Laura, joining her friend next day, just as she
had got the cloak-box well hidden under a layer of
clothes.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I'm almost done, and rather like to
fuss over my own things in my own way. You won't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
mind if I give this pretty box of handkerchiefs to
mother, will you, dear? I have so many things, I
must go halves with some one. The muslin apron
and box of bonbons are for Janey, because she can't
wear the gloves, and this lovely <i>jabot</i> is too old for
her," said Daisy, surveying her new possessions with
girlish satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Do what you like with your own. Mamma has a
box of presents for your people. She is packing it
now, but I don't believe you can get it in; your
trunk is so much fuller than when you came. This
must go in a safe place, or your heart will break,"
and Laura took up the jewel-box, adding with a laugh,
as she opened it, "you haven't filled it, after all!
What did you do with papa's gold piece?"</p>

<p>"That's a secret. I'll tell some day, but not yet,"
said Daisy, diving into her trunk to hide the color in
her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Sly thing! I know you've got silver spiders and
filagree racquets, and Rhine-stone moons and stars
stowed away somewhere and won't confess it. I wanted
to fill this box, but mamma said you'd do it better
yourself, so I let it alone; but I was afraid you'd think
I was a selfish pig, to have a pin for every day in the
month and never give you one," said Laura, as she
looked at the single tarnished brooch reposing on the
satin cushion. "Where's your chain?" she added,
before Daisy could speak.</p>

<p>"It is safe enough. I'm tired of it, and don't care
if I never see it again." And Daisy packed away,
and laughed as she smoothed the white dress in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
tray, remembering that it was paid for by the sale
of the old necklace.</p>

<p>"Give it to me, then. I like it immensely; it's so
odd. I'll exchange for anything of mine you choose.
Will you?" asked Laura, who seemed bent on asking
inconvenient questions.</p>

<p>"I shall have to tell, or she will think me very
ungrateful,"&mdash;and Daisy felt a pang of regret even
then, for Laura's offer was a generous one.</p>

<p>"Like G. W., 'I cannot tell a lie;' so I must 'fess'
that I sold the old thing, and spent the money for
something I wanted very much,&mdash;not jewelry, but
something to give away."</p>

<p>Daisy was spared further confessions by the entrance
of Mrs. Vaughn, with a box in her hand.</p>

<p>"I have room for something more. Give me that,
Laura, it will just fit in;" and taking the little casket,
she added, "Mary White wants to try on your dress,
dear. Go at once; I will help Daisy."</p>

<p>Laura went, and her mother stood looking down at
the kneeling girl with an expression of affectionate satisfaction
which would have puzzled Daisy, had she
seen it.</p>

<p>"Has the visit been a pleasant one, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very! I can't thank you enough for the good
it has done me. I hope I can pay a little of the debt
next summer, if you come our way again," cried Daisy,
looking up with a face full of gratitude.</p>

<p>"We shall probably go to Europe for the summer.
Laura is a good age for it now, and we shall all enjoy it."</p>

<p>"How splendid! We shall miss you dreadfully, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
I'm glad you are going, and I hope Laura will find
time to write me now and then. I shall want to know
how she likes the 'foreign parts' we've talked about
so much."</p>

<p>"You <i>shall</i> know. We won't forget you, my dear,"
and with a caressing touch on the smiling yet wistful
face upturned to hers, Mrs. Vaughn went away to pack
the empty jewel-box, leaving Daisy to drop a few irrepressible
tears on the new gown, over the downfall of
her summer hopes, and the longings all girls feel for
that enchanted world that lies beyond the sea.</p>

<p>"We shall see you before we go, so we won't gush
now," said Laura, as she bade her friend good-by, adding
in a whisper, "Some folks can have secrets as well
as other folks, and be as sly. So don't think you have all
the fun to yourself, you dear, good, generous darling."</p>

<p>Daisy looked bewildered, and Mrs. Vaughn added to
her surprise by kissing her very warmly as she said:</p>

<p>"I wanted to find a good friend for my spoiled girl,
and I think I have succeeded."</p>

<p>There was no time for explanation, and all the
way home Daisy kept wondering what they meant.
But she forgot everything when she saw the dear faces
beaming at the door, and ran straight into her mother's
arms, while Janey hugged the trunk till her turn
came for something better.</p>

<p>When the first raptures were over, out came the
cloak; and Daisy was well repaid for her little trials
and sacrifices when she was folded in it as her mother
held her close, and thanked her as mothers only can.
Sitting in its soft shelter, she told all about it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
coming to the end said, as she took up the jewel-box,
unpacked with the other generous gifts:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I haven't a thing to put in it, but I shall value it
because it taught me a lesson which I hope I never
shall forget. See what a pretty thing it is;" and opening
it, Daisy gave a cry of surprise and joy, for there
lay the golden rose, with Laura's name and "Sub
rosa" on a slip of paper.</p>

<p>"The dear thing! she knew I wanted it, and that
is what she meant by 'secrets.' I'll write and tell her
mine to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Here is something more," said Janey, who had
been lifting the tray while her sister examined the long-desired
flower.</p>

<p>A pair of real gold bangles shone before her delighted
eyes, and a card in Mr. Vaughn's handwriting bore
these words: "Handcuffs for the thief who stole the
pocketbook."</p>

<p>Daisy hardly had time to laugh gayly at the old
gentleman's joke, when Janey cried out, as she opened
the little drawer, "Here's another!"</p>

<p>It was a note from Mrs. Vaughn, but all thought it
the greatest treasure of the three, for it said briefly,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Daisy</span>,&mdash;Mary told me some of your secrets,
and I found out the others. Forgive me and go to Europe
with Laura, in May. Your visit was a little test.
You stood it well, and we want to know more of you.
The little box is not quite empty, but the best jewels
are the self-denial, sweet charity, and good sense you
put in yourself.</p></blockquote>

<div class="signature2">"Your friend, A. V."<br />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Daisy could not speak, and her mother looked into
the box with eyes full of tender tears, while Janey
danced about them, clashing the bangles like a happy
little bayadere, till her sister found her voice again.</p>

<p>Pointing to a great, bright tear that shone on the
blue velvet, she said, with her cheek against her mother's:
"I always wanted a real diamond, and there's a
more precious one than any I could buy. Now I'm
sure my jewel-box <i>is</i> full."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Cornys_Catamount" id="Cornys_Catamount"></a>Corny's Catamount</h2>

<p>Two boys sat on the bars, one whittling, the other
whistling,&mdash;not for want of thought by any means,
for his brow was knit in an anxious frown, and he
paused now and then to thump the rail, with an
impatient exclamation. The other lad appeared to be
absorbed in shaping an arrow from the slender stick
in his hand, but he watched his neighbor with a grin,
saying a few words occasionally which seemed to add
to his irritation, though they were in a sympathizing
tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if a chap can't do a thing he can't; and
he'd better give up and say, 'Beat.'"</p>

<p>"But I won't give up, and I never say 'Beat.'
I'm not going to be laughed out of it, and I'll do
what I said I would, if it takes all summer, Chris
Warner."</p>

<p>"You'll have to be pretty spry, then, for there's
only two more days to August," replied the whittler,
shutting one eye to look along his arrow and see if it
was true.</p>

<p>"I intend to be spry, and if you won't go and blab,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
I'll tell you a plan I made last night."</p>

<p>"Guess you can trust me. I've heard about a
dozen plans now, and never told one of 'em."</p>

<p>"They all failed, so there was nothing to tell. But
this one is <i>not</i> going to fail, if I die for it. I feel that
it's best to tell some one, because it is really dangerous;
and if anything <i>should</i> happen to me, as is
very likely, it would save time and trouble."</p>

<p>"Don't seem to feel anxious a mite. But I'll stand
ready to pick up the pieces, if you come to grief."</p>

<p>"Now, Chris, it's mean of you to keep on making
fun when I'm in dead earnest; and this may be the
last thing you can do for me."</p>

<p>"Wait till I get out my handkerchief; if you're
going to be affectin' I may want it. Granite's cheap
up here; just mention what you'd like on your tombstone
and I'll see that it's done, if it takes my last
cent."</p>

<p>The big boy in the blue overalls spoke with such
a comical drawl that the slender city lad could not
help laughing, and with a slap that nearly sent his
neighbor off his perch, Corny said good-naturedly:</p>

<p>"Come now, stop joking and lend a hand, and I'll
do anything I can for you. I've set my heart on
shooting a wildcat, and I know I can if I once get a
good chance. Mother won't let me go off far enough,
so of course I don't do it, and then you all jeer at me.
To-morrow we are going up the mountain, and I'm
set on trying again, for Abner says the big woods are
the place to find the 'varmint'. Now you hold your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
tongue, and let me slip away when I think we've hit
the right spot. I'm not a bit afraid, and while the
rest go poking to the top, I'll plunge into the woods
and see what I can do."</p>

<p>"All right. Better take old Buff; he'll bring you
home when you get lost, and keep puss from clawing
you. You won't like that part of the fun as much
as you expect to, maybe," said Chris, with a sly
twinkle of the eye, as he glanced at Corny and then
away to the vast forest that stretched far up the
mighty mountain's side.</p>

<p>"No, I don't want any help, and Buff will betray
me by barking; I prefer to go alone. I shall take
some lunch and plenty of shot, and have a glorious
time, even if I don't meet that confounded beast. I
will keep dashing in and out of the woods as we
go; then no one will miss me for a while, and when
they do you just say, 'Oh, he's all right; he'll
be along directly,' and go ahead, and let me
alone."</p>

<p>Corny spoke so confidently, and looked so pleased
with his plan, that honest Chris could not bear to
tell him how much danger he would run in that
pathless forest, where older hunters than he had been
lost.</p>

<p>"Don't feel as if I cared to tell any lies about it,
and I don't advise your goin'; but if you're mad for
catamounts, I s'pose I must humor you and say nothing.
Only bear in mind, Abner and I will be along,
and if you get into a scrape jest give a yell and we'll
come."</p>

<p>"No fear of that; I've tramped round all summer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and know my way like an Indian. Keep the girls
quiet, and let me have a good lark. I'll turn up all
right by sundown; so don't worry. Not a word to
mother, mind, or she won't let me go. I'll make
things straight with her after the fun is over."</p>

<p>"That ain't just square; but it's not my funeral, so
I won't meddle. Hope you'll have first rate sport,
and bag a brace of cats. One thing you mind, don't
get too nigh before you fire; and keep out of sight of
the critters as much as you can."</p>

<p>Chris spoke in a deep whisper, looking so excited
and impressed by the reckless courage of his mate
that Corny felt himself a Leatherstocking, and went
off to tea with his finger on his lips, full of boyish
faith in his own powers. If he had seen Chris dart
behind the barn, and there roll upon the grass in
convulsions of laughter, he would have been both
surprised and hurt.</p>

<p>No deacon could have been more sober, however,
than Chris when they met next morning, while the
party of summer boarders at the old farm-house were
in a pleasant bustle of preparation for the long expected
day on the mountain. Three merry girls, a
pair of small boys, two amiable mammas, Chris and
Corny, made up the party, with Abner to drive the big
wagon drawn by Milk and Molasses, the yellow span.</p>

<p>"All aboard!" shouted our young Nimrod, in a
hurry to be off, as the lunch-basket was handed up,
and the small boys packed in the most uncomfortable
corners, regardless of their arms and legs.</p>

<p>Away they rattled with a parting cheer, and peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
fell upon the farm-house for a few hours, to the great
contentment of the good people left behind. Corny's
mother was one of them, and her last words were,&mdash;"A
pleasant day, dear. I wish you'd leave that gun
at home; I'm so afraid you'll get hurt with it.'</p>

<p>"No fun without it. Don't worry, mammy; I'm
old enough to take care of myself."</p>

<p>"I'll see to him, ma'am," called Chris, as he hung
on behind, and waved his old straw hat, with a steady,
reliable sort of look, that made the anxious lady feel
more comfortable.</p>

<p>"We are going to walk up, and leave the horses to
rest; so I can choose my time. See, I've got a bottle
of cold tea in this pocket, and a lot of grub in the
other. No danger of my starving, is there?" whispered
Corny, as he leaned over to Chris, who sat,
apparently, on nothing, with his long legs dangling
into space.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't wonder if you needed every mite of it.
Hunting is mighty hard work on a hot day, and this
is going to be a blazer," answered Chris, pulling his
big straw hat lower over his eyes.</p>

<p>As we intend to follow Corny's adventures, we need
not pause to describe the drive, which was a merry
one; with girls chattering, mammas holding on to excited
small boys, in danger of flying out at every jolt,
Abner joking till every one roared, Corny's dangerous
evolutions with the beloved gun, and the gymnastic
feats Chris performed, jumping off to pick flowers
for the ladies, and getting on again while Milk and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Molasses tore up and down the rough road as if they
enjoyed it.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock they reached the foot of the
mountain; and after a short rest at the hotel, began
the three-mile ascent in high spirits. Abner was to
follow later with the wagon, to bring the party down;
so Chris was guide, as he knew the way well, and often
came with people. The girls and younger boys hurried
on, full of eagerness to reach the top. The ladies
went more slowly, enjoying the grand beauty of the
scene, while Chris carried the lunch-basket, and Corny
lingered in the rear, waiting for a good chance to
"plunge."</p>

<p>He wanted to be off before Abner came, as he well
knew that wise man and mighty hunter would never
let him go alone.</p>

<p>"The very next path I see, I'll dive in and run;
Chris can't leave the rest to follow, and if I once get
a good start, they won't catch me in a hurry," thought
the boy, longing to be free and alone in the wild woods
that tempted him on either hand.</p>

<p>Just as he was tightening his belt to be ready for
the run, Mrs. Barker, the stout lady, called him; and
being a well-bred lad, he hastened at once to see what
she wanted, feeling that he was the only gentleman in
the party.</p>

<p>"Give me your arm, dear; I'm getting very tired,
and fear I can't hold out to the top, without a little
help," said the poor lady, red and panting with the
heat, and steepness of the road.</p>

<p>"Certainly ma'am," answered Corny, obeying at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
once, and inwardly resolving to deposit his fair burden
on the first fallen log they came to, and make his
escape.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Barker got on bravely, with the support
of his strong arm, and chatted away so delightfully
that Corny would really have enjoyed the walk, if his
soul had not been yearning for catamounts. He did
his best, but when they passed opening after opening
into the green recesses of the wood, and the granite
boulders grew more and more plentiful, his patience
gave out, and he began to plan what he could say to
excuse himself. Chris was behind, apparently deaf
and blind to his calls and imploring glances, though
he grinned cheerfully when poor Corny looked round
and beckoned, as well as he could, with a gun on one
arm and a stout lady on the other.</p>

<p>"The hardest part is coming now, and we'd better
rest a moment. Here's a nice rock, and the last
spring we are likely to see till we get to the top.
Come on, Chris, and give us the dipper. Mrs. Barker
wants a drink, and so do I," called the young hunter,
driven to despair at last.</p>

<p>Up came Chris, and while he rummaged in the well-packed
basket, Corny slipped into the wood, leaving
the good lady with her thanks half spoken, sitting on
a warm stone beside a muddy little pool. A loud
laugh followed him, as he scrambled through the tall
ferns and went plunging down the steep mountain
side, eager to reach the lower woods.</p>

<p>"Let him laugh; it will be my turn when I go home,
with a fine cat over my shoulder," thought Corny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
tearing along, heedless of falls, scratches, and bruised
knees.</p>

<p>At length he paused for breath, and looked about
him well satisfied, for the spot was lonely and lovely
enough to suit any hunter. The tallest pines he ever
saw sighed far overhead; the ground was ankle deep
in moss, and gay with scarlet bunch-berries; every
fallen log was veiled by sweet-scented Linnea, green
vines or nodding brakes; while hidden brooks sang
musically, and the air was full of the soft flutter of
leaves, the whir of wings, the sound of birds gossiping
sweetly in the safe shelter of the forest, where human
feet so seldom came.</p>

<p>"I'll rest a bit, and then go along down, keeping
a look out for puss by the way," thought Corny, feeling
safe and free, and very happy, for he had his own
way, at last, and a whole day to lead the life he loved.</p>

<p>So he bathed his hot face, took a cool drink, and
lay on the moss, staring up into the green gloom of
the pines, blissfully dreaming of the joys of a hunter's
life,&mdash;till a peculiar cry startled him to his feet, and
sent him creeping warily toward the sound. Whether
it was a new kind of bird, or a fox, or a bear, he did not
know, but fondly hoped it was a wildcat; though he
was well aware that the latter creature sleeps by day,
and prowls by night. Abner said they purred and
snarled and gave a mewing sort of cry; but which it
was now he could not tell, having unfortunately been
half asleep.</p>

<p>On he went, looking up into the trees for a furry
bunch, behind every log, and in every rocky hole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
longing and hoping to discover his heart's desire. But
a hawk was all he saw above, an ugly snake was the
only living thing he found among the logs, and a fat
woodchuck's hind legs vanished down the most attractive
hole. He shot at all three and missed them, so
pushed on, pretending that he did not care for such
small game.</p>

<p>"Now this is what I call fun," he said to himself,
tramping gayly along, and at that moment went splash
into a mud-hole concealed under the grass. He sunk
up to his knees, and with great difficulty got out by
clinging to the tussocks that grew near. In his struggles
the lunch was lost, for the bottle broke and the
pocket where the sandwiches were stored was full of
mud. A woful spectacle was the trim lad as he
emerged from the slough, black and dripping in front,
well spattered behind, hatless, and one shoe gone, having
been carelessly left unlaced in the ardor of the
chase.</p>

<p>"Here's a mess!" thought poor Corny, surveying
himself with great disgust and feeling very helpless, as
well as tired, hungry, and mad. "Luckily, my powder
is dry and my gun safe; so my fun isn't spoiled, though
I do look like a wallowing pig. I've heard of mud
baths, but I never took one before, and I'll be shot if
I do again."</p>

<p>So he washed as well as he could, hoping the sun
would dry him, picked out a few bits of bread unspoiled
by the general wreck, and trudged on with less ardor,
though by no means discouraged yet.</p>

<p>"I'm too high for any game but birds, and those I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
don't want. I'll go slap down, and come out in the
valley. Abner said any brook would show the way,
and this rascal that led me into a scrape shall lead me
out," he said, as he followed the little stream that
went tumbling over the stones, that increased as the
ground sloped toward the deep ravine, where a waterfall
shone like silver in the sun.</p>

<p>"I'll take a bath if the pool is big enough, and
that will set me up. Shouldn't wonder if I'd got
poisoned a bit with some of these vines I've been tearing
through. My hands smart like fury, and I guess
the mosquitoes have about eaten my face up. Never
saw such clouds of stingers before," said Corny, looking
at his scratched hands, and rubbing his hot face in
great discomfort,&mdash;for it was the gnat that drove the
lion mad, you remember.</p>

<p>It was easy to say, "I'll follow the brook," but not
so easy to do it; for the frolicsome stream went headlong
over rocks, crept under fallen logs, and now and
then hid itself so cleverly that one had to look and
listen carefully to recover the trail. It was long past
noon when Corny came out near the waterfall, so tired
and hungry that he heartily wished himself back
among the party, who had lunched well and were now
probably driving gayly homeward to a good supper.</p>

<p>No chance for a bath appeared, so he washed his
burning face and took a rest, enjoying the splendid
view far over valley and intervale through the gap in the
mountain range. He was desperately tired with these
hours of rough travel, and very hungry; but would not
own it, and sat considering what to do next, for he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
by the sun that the afternoon was half over. There
was time to go back the way he had come, and by following
the path down the hill he could reach the hotel
and get supper and a bed, or be driven home. That
was the wise thing to do, but his pride rebelled against
returning empty-handed after all his plans and boasts
of great exploits.</p>

<p>"I won't go home, to be laughed at by Chris and
Abner. I'll shoot something, if I stay all night. Who
cares for hunger and mosquito bites? Not I. Hunters
can bear more than that, I guess. The next live
thing I see I'll shoot it, and make a fire and have a
jolly supper. Now which way will I go,&mdash;up or down?
A pretty hard prospect, either way."</p>

<p>The sight of an eagle soaring above him seemed to
answer his question, and fill him with new strength
and ardor. To shoot the king of birds and take him
home in triumph would cover the hunter with glory.
It should be done! And away he went, climbing,
tumbling, leaping from rock to rock, toward the place
where the eagle had alighted. More cuts and bruises,
more vain shots, and all the reward of his eager struggles
was a single feather that floated down as the great
bird soared serenely away, leaving the boy exhausted
and disappointed in a wilderness of granite boulders,
with no sign of a path to show the way out.</p>

<p>As he leaned breathless and weary against the crag
where he had fondly hoped to find the eagle's nest, he
realized for the first time what a fool-hardy thing he
had done. Here he was, alone, without a guide, in this
wild region where there was neither food nor shelter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and night coming on. Utterly used up, he could not
get home now if he had known the way; and suddenly
all the tales he had ever heard of men lost in the
mountains came into his head. If he had not been
weak with hunger he would have felt better able to
bear it; but his legs trembled under him, his head
ached with the glare of the sun, and a queer faintness
came over him now and then; for the city lad was
unused to such violent exercise, plucky as he was.</p>

<p>"The only thing to do now is to get down to the
valley, if I can, before dark. Abner said there was an
old cabin, where the hunters used to sleep, somewhere
round that way. I can try for it, and perhaps shoot
something on the way. May break my bones, but I
can't sit and starve up here, and I was a fool to come.
I'll keep the feather anyway, to prove that I really
saw an eagle; that's better than nothing."</p>

<p>Still bravely trying to affect the indifference to danger
and fatigue which hunters are always described as
possessing in such a remarkable degree, Corny slung
the useless gun on his back and began the steep descent,
discovering now the perils he had been too eager to
see before. He was a good climber, but was stiff with
weariness, and his hands already sore with scratches
and poison; so he went slowly, feeling quite unfit for
such hard work. Coming to the ravine, he found the
only road was down its precipitous side to the valley,
that looked so safe and pleasant now. Stunted pines
grew in the fissures of the rocks, and their strong roots
helped the clinging hands and feet as the boy painfully
climbed, slipped, and swung along, fearing every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
minute to come to some impassable barrier in the
dangerous path.</p>

<p>But he got on wonderfully well, and was feeling
much encouraged, when his foot slipped, the root he
held gave way, and down he went, rolling and bumping
to his death on the rocks below, he thought, as a crash
came, and he knew no more.</p>

<p>"Wonder if I'm dead?" was the first idea that occurred
to him as he opened his eyes and saw a brilliant
sky above him, all purple, gold, and red.</p>

<p>He seemed floating in the air, for he swayed to and
fro on a soft bed, a pleasant murmur reached his ear,
and when he looked down he saw what looked like
clouds, misty and white, below him. He lay a few
minutes drowsily musing, for the fall had stunned
him; then, as he moved his hand something pricked
it, and he felt pine-needles in the fingers that closed
over them.</p>

<p>"Caught in a tree, by Jupiter!" and all visions of
heaven vanished in a breath, as he sat up and stared
about him, wide awake now, and conscious of many
aching bones.</p>

<p>Yes, there he lay among the branches of one of the
sturdy pines, into which he had fallen on his way
down the precipice. Blessed little tree! set there to
save a life, and teach a lesson to a wilful young heart
that never forgot that hour.</p>

<p>Holding fast, lest a rash motion should set him
bounding further down, like a living ball, Corny took
an observation as rapidly as possible, for the red light
was fading, and the mist rising from the valley.   All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
he could see was a narrow ledge where the tree stood,
and anxious to reach a safer bed for the night, he
climbed cautiously down to drop on the rock, so full
of gratitude for safety that he could only lie quite
still for a little while, thinking of mother, and trying
not to cry.</p>

<p>He was much shaken by the fall, his flesh bruised,
his clothes torn, and his spirit cowed; for hunger,
weariness, pain, and danger, showed him what a very
feeble creature he was, after all. He could do no
more till morning, and resigned himself to a night on
the mountain side, glad to be there alive, though
doubtful what daylight would show him. Too tired
to move, he lay watching the western sky, where the
sun set gloriously behind the purple hills. All below
was wrapped in mist, and not a sound reached him
but the sigh of the pine, and the murmur of the waterfall.</p>

<p>"This is a first-class scrape. What a fool I was
not to go back when I could, instead of blundering
down here where no one can get at me, and as like as
not I can't get out alone! Gun smashed in that confounded
fall, so I can't even fire a shot to call help.
Nothing to eat or drink, and very likely a day or so
to spend here till I'm found, if I ever am. Chris said,
'Yell, if you want us.' Much good that would do
now! I'll try, though." And getting up on his
weary legs, Corny shouted till he was hoarse; but
echo alone answered him, and after a few efforts
he gave it up, trying to accept the situation like a
man.   As if kind Nature took pity on the poor boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the little ledge was soft with lichens and thin grass,
and here and there grew a sprig of checkerberry, sown
by the wind, sheltered by the tree, and nourished by
the moisture that trickled down the rock from some
hidden spring. Eagerly Corny ate the sweet leaves
to stay the pangs of hunger that gnawed him, and
finished his meal with grass and pine-needles, calling
himself a calf, and wishing his pasture were wider.</p>

<p>"The fellows we read about always come to grief in
a place where they can shoot a bird, catch a fish, or
knock over some handy beast for supper," he said,
talking to himself for company. "Even the old chap
lost in the bush in Australia had a savage with him
who dug a hole in a tree, and pulled out a nice fat
worm to eat. I'm not lucky enough even to find a
sassafras bush to chew, or a bird's egg to suck. My
poor gun is broken, or I might bang away at a hawk,
and cook him for supper, if the bog didn't spoil my
matches as it did my lunch. Oh, well! I'll pull
through, I guess, and when it's all over, it will be a
jolly good story to tell."</p>

<p>Then, hoping to forget his woes in sleep, he nestled
under the low-growing branches of the pine, and lay
blinking drowsily at the twilight world outside. A
dream came, and he saw the old farm-house in sad
confusion, caused by his absence,&mdash;the women crying,
the men sober, all anxious, and all making ready to
come and look for him. So vivid was it that he woke
himself by crying out, "Here I am!" and nearly went
over the ledge, stretching out his arms to Abner.</p>

<p>The start and the scare made it hard to go to sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
again, and he sat looking at the solemn sky, full of
stars that seemed watching over him alone there, like
a poor, lost child on the great mountain's stony breast.
He had never seen the world at that hour before, and it
made a deep impression on him; for it was a vast, wild
scene, full of gloomy shadows below, unknown dangers
around, and a new sense of utter littleness and helplessness,
which taught the boy human dependence upon
Heavenly love as no words, even from his mother's tender
lips, could have done. Thoughts of the suffering
his wilfulness had given her wrung a few penitent tears
from him, which he was not ashamed to shed, since
only the kind stars saw them, and better still, he resolved
to own the fault, to atone for it, and to learn
wisdom from this lesson, which might yet prove to
be a very bitter one.</p>

<p>He felt better after this little breakdown, and presently
his thoughts were turned from conscience to catamounts
again; for sounds in the woods below led him
to believe that the much-desired animal was on the
prowl. His excited fancy painted dozens of them not
far away, waiting to be shot, and there he was, cooped
up on that narrow ledge, with a broken gun, unable
even to get a look at them. He felt that it was a just
punishment, and after the first regret tried to comfort
himself with the fact that he was much safer where he
was than alone in the forest at that hour, for various
nocturnal voices suggested restless and dangerous
neighbors.</p>

<p>Presently his wakeful eyes saw lights twinkling far
off on the opposite side of the ravine, and he imagined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
he heard shouts and shots. But the splash of the waterfall,
and the rush of the night wind deadened the
sounds to his ear, and drowned his own reply.</p>

<p>"They are looking for me, and will never think of
this strange place. I can't make them hear, and must
wait till morning. Poor Chris will get an awful scolding
for letting me go. Don't believe he told a word
till he had to. I'll make it up to him. Chris is a
capital fellow, and I just wish I had him here to make
things jolly," thought the lonely lad.</p>

<p>But soon the lights vanished, the sounds died away,
and the silence of midnight brooded over the hills,
seldom broken except by the soft cry of an owl, the
rustle of the pine, or a louder gust of wind as it grew
strong and cold. Corny kept awake as long as he
could, fearing to dream and fall; but by-and-by he
dropped off, and slept soundly till the chill of dawn
waked him.</p>

<p>At any other time he would have heartily enjoyed
the splendor of the eastern sky, as the red glow spread
and brightened, till the sun came dazzling through the
gorge, making the wild solitude beautiful and grand.</p>

<p>Now, however, he would have given it all for a hot
beefsteak and a cup of coffee, as he wet his lips with a
few drops of ice-cold water, and browsed over his small
pasture till not a green spire remained. He was stiff,
and full of pain, but daylight and the hope of escape
cheered him up, and gave him coolness and courage to
see how best he could accomplish his end.</p>

<p>The wind soon blew away the mist and let him see
that the dry bed of a stream lay just below. To reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
it he must leap, at risk of his bones, or find some means
to swing down ten or twelve feet. Once there, it was
pretty certain that by following the rough road he
would come into the valley, from whence he could
easily find his way home. Much elated at this unexpected
good fortune, he took the strap that had slung
his gun, the leathern belt about his waist, and the
strong cords of his pouch, and knotting them together,
made a rope long enough to let him drop within two
or three feet of the stones below. This he fastened
firmly round the trunk of the pine, and finished his
preparations by tying his handkerchief to one of the
branches, that it might serve as a guide for him, a
signal for others, and a trophy of his grand fall.</p>

<p>Then putting a little sprig of the evergreen tree in
his jacket, with a grateful thought of all it had done
for him, he swung himself off and landed safely below,
not minding a few extra bumps after his late exploits
at tumbling.</p>

<p>Feeling like a prisoner set free, he hurried as fast as
bare feet and stiff legs would carry him along the bed
of the stream, coming at last into the welcome shelter of
the woods, which seemed more beautiful than ever, after
the bleak region of granite in which he had been all night.</p>

<p>Anxious to report himself alive, and relieve his
mother's anxiety, he pressed on till he struck the path,
and soon saw, not far away, the old cabin Abner had
spoken of. Just before this happy moment he had
heard a shot fired somewhere in the forest, and as he
hurried toward the sound he saw an animal dart into
the hut, as if for shelter.</p>

<p>Whether it was a rabbit, woodchuck or dog, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
not seen, as a turn in the path prevented a clear view;
and hoping it was old Buff looking for him, he ran in,
to find himself face to face with a catamount at
last.</p>

<p>There she was, the big, fierce cat, crouched in a corner,
with fiery eyes, growling and spitting at sight of
an enemy, but too badly wounded to fight, as the blood
that dripped from her neck, and the tremble of her
limbs plainly showed.</p>

<p>"Now's my chance! Don't care who shot her,
I'll kill her, and have her too, if I pay my last
dollar," thought Corny; and catching up a stout bit
of timber fallen from the old roof, he struck one quick
blow, which finished poor puss, who gave up the ghost
with a savage snarl, and a vain effort to pounce on
him.</p>

<p>This splendid piece of good luck atoned for all the
boy had gone through, and only waiting to be sure
the beast was quite dead and past clawing, he flung
his prize over his shoulder, and with renewed strength
and spirit trudged along the woodland road toward
home, proudly imagining his triumphal entry upon
the scene of suspense and alarm.</p>

<p>"Wish I didn't look so like a scare-crow; but
perhaps my rags will add to the effect. Won't the
girls laugh at my swelled face, and scream at the
cat. Poor mammy will mourn over me and coddle
me up as if I'd been to the wars. Hope some house
isn't very far off, for I don't believe I can lug this
brute much farther, I'm so starved and shaky."</p>

<p>Just as he paused to take breath and shift his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
burden from one shoulder to the other, a loud shout
startled him, and a moment after, several men came
bursting through the wood, cheering like lunatics as
they approached.</p>

<p>It was Abner, Chris, and some of the neighbors,
setting out again on their search, after a night of vain
wandering. Corny could have hugged them all and
cried like a girl; but pride kept him steady, though
his face showed his joy as he nodded his hatless head
with a cool&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hullo!"</p>

<p>Chris burst into his ringing laugh, and danced a
wild sort of jig round his mate, as the only way in
which he could fitly express his relief; for he had
been so bowed down with remorse at his imprudence
in letting Corny go that no one could find the heart
to blame him, and all night the poor lad had rushed
up and down seeking, calling, hoping, and fearing, till
he was about used up, and looked nearly as dilapidated
as Corny.</p>

<p>The tale was soon told, and received with the most
flattering signs of interest, wonder, sympathy, and
admiration.</p>

<p>"Why in thunder didn't you tell me?&mdash;and I'd a
got up a hunt wuth havin',&mdash;not go stramashing off
alone on a wild goose chase like this. Never did see
such a chap as you be for gittin' inter scrapes,&mdash;and
out of 'em too, I'm bound to own," growled Abner.</p>

<p>"That isn't a wild goose, is it?" proudly demanded
Corny, pointing to the cat, which now lay on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the ground, while he leaned against a tree to hide his
weariness; for he felt ready to drop, now all the
excitement was over.</p>

<p>"No it ain't, and I congratulate you on a good job.
Where did you shoot her?" asked Abner, stooping to
examine the creature.</p>

<p>"Didn't shoot her; broke my gun when I took
that header down the mountain. I hit her a rap with
a club, in the cabin where I found her," answered
Corny, heartily wishing he need not share the prize
with any one. But he was honest, and added at
once, "Some one else had put a bullet into her; I
only finished her off."</p>

<p>"Chris did it; he fired a spell back and see the
critter run, but we was too keen after you to stop for
any other game. Guess you've had enough of catamounts
for one spell, hey?" and Abner laughed as he
looked at poor Corny, who was a more sorry spectacle
than he knew,&mdash;ragged and rough, hatless and shoeless,
his face red and swelled with the poisoning and
bites, his eyes heavy with weariness, and in his
mouth a bit of wild-cherry bark which he chewed
ravenously.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't! I want this one, and will buy it
if Chris will let me. I said I'd kill one, and I did,
and want to keep the skin; for I ought to have something
to show after all this knocking about and turning
somersaults half a mile long," answered Corny
stoutly, as he tried to shoulder his load again.</p>

<p>"Here, give me the varmint, and you hang on to
Chris, my boy, or we'll have to cart you home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
You've done first-rate, and now you want a good
meal of vittles to set you up. Right about face,
neighbors, and home we go, to the tune of Hail
Columby."</p>

<p>As Abner spoke, the procession set forth. The
tall, jolly man, with the dead animal at his back, went
first; then Corny, trying not to lean on the arm Chris
put round him, but very glad of the support; next the
good farmers, all talking at once; while old Buff
soberly brought up the rear, with his eye on the wildcat,
well knowing that he would have a fine feast
when the handsome skin was off.</p>

<p>In this order they reached home, and Corny tumbled
into his mother's arms, to be no more seen for
some hours. What went on in her room, no one
knows; but when at last the hero emerged, refreshed
by sleep and food, clad in clean clothes, his wounds
bound up, and plantain-leaves dipped in cream spread
upon his afflicted countenance, he received the praises
and congratulations showered upon him very meekly.
He made no more boasts of skill and courage that
summer, set out on no more wild hunts, and gave up
his own wishes so cheerfully that it was evident something
had worked a helpful change in wilful Corny.</p>

<p>He liked to tell the story of that day and night
when his friends were recounting adventures by sea
and land; but he never said much about the hours on
the ledge, always owned that Chris shot the beast,
and usually ended by sagely advising his hearers to
let their mothers know, when they went off on a lark
of that kind. Those who knew and loved him best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
observed that he was fonder than ever of nibbling
checkerberry leaves, that he didn't mind being
laughed at for liking to wear a bit of pine in his
buttonhole, and that the skin of the catamount so
hardly won lay before his study table till the moths
ate it up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>

<h2><a name="The_Cooking_Class" id="The_Cooking_Class"></a>The Cooking Class</h2>


<p>A young girl in a little cap and a big apron sat
poring over a cook-book, with a face full of the deepest
anxiety. She had the kitchen to herself, for mamma
was out for the day, cook was off duty, and Edith
could mess to her heart's content. She belonged to
a cooking-class, the members of which were to have
a lunch at two P. M. with the girl next door; and now
the all absorbing question was, what to make. Turning
the pages of the well-used book, she talked to
herself as the various receipts met her eye.</p>

<p>"Lobster-salad and chicken-croquettes I've had,
and neither were very good. Now I want to distinguish
myself by something very nice. I'd try a
meat-porcupine or a mutton-duck if there was time;
but they are fussy, and ought to be rehearsed before
given to the class. Bavarian cream needs berries
and whipped cream, and I <i>won't</i> tire my arms beating
eggs. Apricots <i> la</i> Neige is an easy thing and wholesome,
but the girls won't like it, I know, as well as
some rich thing that will make them ill, as Carrie's
plum-pudding did. A little meat dish is best for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
lunch. I'd try sweetbreads and bacon, if I didn't
hate to burn my face and scent my clothes, frying.
Birds are elegant; let me see if I can do larded
grouse. No, I don't like to touch that cold, fat stuff.
How mortified Ella was, when she had birds on toast
and forgot to draw them. I shouldn't make such a
blunder as that, I do hope. Potted pigeons&mdash;the
very thing! Had that in our last lesson, but the
girls are all crazy about puff-paste, so they won't try
pigeons. Why didn't I think of it at once?&mdash;for we've
got them in the house, and don't want them to-day,
mamma being called away. All ready too; so nice!
I do detest to pick and clean birds. 'Simmer from
one to three hours.' Plenty of time. I'll do it!
I'll do it! La, la, la!"</p>

<p>And away skipped Edith in high spirits, for she did
not love to cook, yet wished to stand well with the
class, some members of which were very ambitious,
and now and then succeeded with an elaborate dish,
more by good luck than skill.</p>

<p>Six plump birds were laid out on a platter, with
their legs folded in the most pathetic manner; these
Edith bore away in triumph to the kitchen, and opening
the book before her went to work energetically,
resigning herself to frying the pork and cutting up
the onion, which she had overlooked when hastily
reading the receipt. In time they were stuffed, the
legs tied down to the tails, the birds browned in the
stew-pan, and put to simmer with a pinch of herbs.</p>

<p>"Now I can clear up, and rest a bit. If I ever
have to work for a living I <i>won't</i> be a cook," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Edith, with a sigh of weariness as she washed her
dishes, wondering how there could be so many; for
no careless Irish girl would have made a greater
clutter over this small job than the young lady who
had not yet learned one of the most important things
that a cook should know.</p>

<p>The bell rang just as she got done, and was planning
to lie and rest on the dining-room sofa till it was
time to take up her pigeons.</p>

<p>"Tell whoever it is that I'm engaged," she whispered,
as the maid passed, on her way to the door.</p>

<p>"It's your cousin, miss, from the country, and she
has a trunk with her. Of course she's to come in?"
asked Maria, coming back in a moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me! I forgot all about Patty. Mamma
said any day this week, and this is the most inconvenient
one of the seven. Of course, she must come
in. Go and tell her I'll be there in a minute,"
answered Edith, too well bred not to give even an
unwelcome guest a kindly greeting.</p>

<p>Whisking off cap and apron, and taking a last look
at the birds, just beginning to send forth a savory
steam, she went to meet her cousin.</p>

<p>Patty was a rosy, country lass of sixteen, plainly
dressed and rather shy, but a sweet, sensible little
body, with a fresh, rustic air which marked her for a
field-flower at once.</p>

<p>"How do you do, dear? so sorry mamma is away;
called to a sick friend in a hurry. But I'm here and
glad to see you. I've an engagement at two, and
you shall go with me. It's only a lunch close by,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
just a party of girls; I'll tell you about it upstairs."</p>

<p>Chatting away, Edith led Patty up to the pretty
room ready for her, and soon both were laughing over
a lively account of the exploits of the cooking-class.
Suddenly, in the midst of the cream-pie which had been
her great success, and nearly the death of all who
partook thereof, Edith paused, sniffed the air like a
hound, and crying tragically, "They are burning!
They are burning!" rushed down stairs as if the
house was on fire.</p>

<p>Much alarmed, Patty hurried after her, guided to
the kitchen by the sound of lamentation. There she
found Edith hanging over a stew-pan, with anguish in
her face and despair in her voice, as she breathlessly
explained the cause of her flight.</p>

<p>"My pigeons! Are they burnt? Do smell and
tell me? After all my trouble I shall be heart-broken
if they are spoilt."</p>

<p>Both pretty noses sniffed and sniffed again as the
girls bent over the pan, regardless of the steam which
was ruining their crimps and reddening their noses.
Reluctantly, Patty owned that a slight flavor of scorch
did pervade the air, but suggested that a touch more
seasoning would conceal the sad fact.</p>

<p>"I'll try it. Did you ever do any? Do you love
to cook? Don't you want to make something to
carry? It would please the girls, and make up for
my burnt mess," said Edith, as she skimmed the
broth and added pepper and salt with a lavish
hand:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about pigeons, except to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
feed and pet them. We don't eat ours. I can cook
plain dishes, and make all kinds of bread. Would
biscuit or tea-cake do?"</p>

<p>Patty looked so pleased at the idea of contributing
to the feast, that Edith could not bear to tell her that
hot biscuit and tea-cake were not just the thing for a
city lunch. She accepted the offer, and Patty fell to
work so neatly and skilfully that, by the time the
pigeons were done, two pans full of delicious little
biscuit were baked, and, folded in a nice napkin, lay
ready to carry off in the porcelain plate with a wreath
of roses painted on it.</p>

<p>In spite of all her flavoring, the burnt odor and
taste still lingered round Edith's dish; but fondly
hoping no one would perceive it, she dressed hastily,
gave Patty a touch here and there, and set forth at
the appointed time to Augusta's lunch.</p>

<p>Six girls belonged to this class, and the rule was for
each to bring her contribution and set it on the table
prepared to receive them all; then, when the number
was complete, the covers were raised, the dishes examined,
eaten (if possible), and pronounced upon, the
prize being awarded to the best. The girl at whose
house the lunch was given provided the prize, and
they were often both pretty and valuable.</p>

<p>On this occasion a splendid bouquet of Jaqueminot
roses in a lovely vase ornamented the middle of the
table, and the eyes of all rested admiringly upon it,
as the seven girls gathered round, after depositing their
dishes.</p>

<p>Patty had been kindly welcomed, and soon forgot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
her shyness in wonder at the handsome dresses, graceful
manners, and lively gossip of the girls. A pleasant,
merry set, all wearing the uniform of the class, dainty
white aprons and coquettish caps with many-colored
ribbons, like stage maid-servants. At the sound of a
silver bell, each took her place before the covered
dish which bore her name, and when Augusta said,
"Ladies, we will begin," off went napkins, silver covers,
white paper, or whatever hid the contribution from
longing eyes. A moment of deep silence, while quick
glances took in the prospect, and then a unanimous
explosion of laughter followed; for six platters of
potted pigeons stood upon the board, with nothing
but the flowers to break the ludicrous monotony of the
scene.</p>

<p>How they laughed! for a time they could do nothing
else, because if one tried to explain she broke
down and joined in the gale of merriment again quite
helplessly. One or two got hysterical and cried as
well as laughed, and all made such a noise that Augusta's
mamma peeped in to see what was the matter.
Six agitated hands pointed to the comical sight on the
table, which looked as if a flight of potted pigeons had
alighted there, and six breathless voices cried in a
chorus: "Isn't it funny? Don't tell!"</p>

<p>Much amused, the good lady retired to enjoy the
joke alone, while the exhausted girls wiped their eyes
and began to talk, all at once. Such a clatter! but
out of it all Patty evolved the fact that each meant to
surprise the rest,&mdash;and they certainly had.</p>

<p>"I tried puff-paste," said Augusta, fanning her hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
face.</p>

<p>"So did I," cried the others.</p>

<p>"And it was a dead failure."</p>

<p>"So was mine," echoed the voices.</p>

<p>"Then I thought I'd do the other dish we had that
day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just what I did."</p>

<p>"Feeling sure you would all try the pastry, and
perhaps get on better than I."</p>

<p>"Exactly our case," and a fresh laugh ended this
general confession.</p>

<p>"Now we must eat our pigeons, as we have nothing
else, and it is against the rule to add from outside
stores. I propose that we each pass our dish round;
then we can all criticise it, and so get some good out of
this very funny lunch."</p>

<p>Augusta's plan was carried out; and all being hungry
after their unusual exertions, the girls fell upon the unfortunate
birds like so many famished creatures. The
first one went very well, but when the dishes were
passed again, each taster looked at it anxiously; for
none were very good, there was nothing to fall back upon,
and variety is the spice of life, as every one knows.</p>

<p>"Oh, for a slice of bread," sighed one damsel.</p>

<p>"Why didn't we think of it?" asked another.</p>

<p>"I did, but we always have so much cake I thought
it was foolish to lay in rolls," exclaimed Augusta,
rather mortified at the neglect.</p>

<p>"I expected to have to taste six pies, and one
doesn't want bread with pastry, you know."</p>

<p>As Edith spoke she suddenly remembered Patty's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
biscuit, which had been left on the side-table by their
modest maker, as there seemed to be no room for
them.</p>

<p>Rejoicing now over the rather despised dish, Edith
ran to get it, saying as she set it in the middle, with a
flourish:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My cousin's contribution. She came so late we
only had time for that. So glad I took the liberty of
bringing her and them."</p>

<p>A murmur of welcome greeted the much-desired addition
to the feast, which would have been a decided
failure without it, and the pretty plate went briskly
round, till nothing was left but the painted roses in it.
With this help the best of the potted pigeons were
eaten, while a lively discussion went on about what
they would have next time.</p>

<p>"Let us each tell our dish, and not change. We
shall never learn if we don't keep to one thing till we
do it well. I will choose mince-pie, and bring a good
one, if it takes me all the week to do it," said Edith,
heroically taking the hardest thing she could think of,
to encourage the others.</p>

<p>Fired by this noble example, each girl pledged herself
to do or die, and a fine list of rich dishes was
made out by these ambitious young cooks. Then a
vote of thanks to Patty was passed, her biscuit unanimously
pronounced the most successful contribution,
and the vase presented to the delighted girl, whose
blushes were nearly as deep as the color of the flowers
behind which she tried to hide them.</p>

<p>Soon after this ceremony the party broke up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Edith went home to tell the merry story, proudly
adding that the country cousin had won the prize.</p>

<p>"You rash child, to undertake mince-pie. It is one
of the hardest things to make, and about the most
unwholesome when eaten. Read the receipt and see
what you have pledged yourself to do, my dear," said
her mother, much amused at the haps and mishaps of
the cooking-class.</p>

<p>Edith opened her book and started bravely off at
"Puff-paste;" but by the time she had come to the
end of the three pages devoted to directions for the
making of that indigestible delicacy, her face was very
sober, and when she read aloud the following receipt
for the mince-meat, despair slowly settled upon her
like a cloud.</p>

<blockquote><p>One cup chopped meat; 1-1/2 cups raisins; 1-1/2 cups
currants; 1-1/2 cups brown sugar; 1-1/3 cups molasses; 3 cups
chopped apples; 1 cup meat liquor; 2 teaspoonfuls salt;
2 teaspoonfuls cinnamon; 1/2 teaspoonful mace; 1/2 teaspoonful
powdered cloves; 1 lemon, grated; 1/4 piece citron,
sliced; 1/2 cup brandy; 1/4 cup wine; 3 teaspoonfuls rosewater.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Oh me, what a job! I shall have to work at it
every day till next Saturday, for the paste alone will
take all the wits I've got. I <i>was</i> rash, but I spoke
without thinking, and wanted to do something really
fine. We can't be shown about things, so I must
blunder along as well as I can," groaned Edith.</p>

<p>"I can help about the measuring and weighing, and
chopping. I always help mother at Thanksgiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
time, and she makes splendid pies. We only have
mince then, as she thinks it's bad for us," said Patty,
full of sympathy and good will.</p>

<p>"What are you to take to the lunch?" asked
Edith's mother, smiling at her daughter's mournful
face, bent over the fatal book full of dainty messes,
that tempted the unwary learner to her doom.</p>

<p>"Only coffee. I can't make fancy things, but my
coffee is always good. They said they wanted it, so I
offered."</p>

<p>"I will have my pills and powders ready, for if you
all go on at this rate you will need a dose of some sort
after your lunch. Give your orders, Edith, and devote
your mind to the task. I wish you good luck
and good digestion, my dears."</p>

<p>With that the mamma left the girls to cheer one
another, and lay plans for a daily lesson till the perfect
pie was made.</p>

<p>They certainly did their best, for they began on
Monday, and each morning through the week went to
the mighty task with daily increasing courage and
skill. They certainly needed the former, for even
good-natured Nancy got tired of having "the young ladies
messing round so much," and looked cross as the
girls appeared in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Edith's brothers laughed at the various failures
which appeared at table, and dear mamma was tired
of tasting pastry and mince-meat in all stages of
progression. But the undaunted damsels kept on till
Saturday came, and a very superior pie stood ready to
be offered for the inspection of the class.</p>

<p>"I never want to see another," said Edith, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
girls dressed together, weary, but well satisfied with
their labor; for the pie had been praised by all beholders,
and the fragrance of Patty's coffee filled the
house, as it stood ready to be poured, hot and clear,
into the best silver pot, at the last moment.</p>

<p>"Well, I feel as if I'd lived in a spice mill this
week, or a pastry-cook's kitchen; and I am glad we are
done. Your brothers won't get any pie for a long
while I guess, if it depends on you," laughed Patty,
putting on the new ribbons her cousin had given
her.</p>

<p>"When Florence's brothers were here last night, I
heard those rascals making all sorts of fun of us, and
Alf said we ought to let them come to lunch. I
scorned the idea, and made their mouths water telling
about the good things we were going to have," said
Edith, exulting over the severe remarks she had made
to these gluttonous young men, who adored pie, yet
jeered at unfortunate cooks.</p>

<p>Florence, the lunch-giver of the week, had made
her table pretty with a posy at each place, put the
necessary roll in each artistically folded napkin, and
hung the prize from the gas burner,&mdash;a large blue satin
bag full of the most delicious bonbons money could
buy. There was some delay about beginning, as one
distracted cook sent word that her potato-puffs
<i>wouldn't</i> brown, and begged them to wait for her. So
they adjourned to the parlor, and talked till the
flushed, but triumphant Ella arrived with the puffs in
fine order.</p>

<p>When all was ready, and the covers raised, another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
surprise awaited them; not a merry one, like the last,
but a very serious affair, which produced domestic
warfare in two houses at least. On each dish lay a
card bearing a new name for these carefully prepared
delicacies. The mince-pie was re-christened "Nightmare,"
veal cutlets "Dyspepsia," escalloped lobster
"Fits," lemon sherbet "Colic," coffee "Palpitation,"
and so on, even to the pretty sack of confectionery
which was labelled "Toothache."</p>

<p>Great was the indignation of the insulted cooks, and
a general cry of "Who did it?" arose. The poor
maid who waited on them declared with tears that not
a soul had been in, and she herself only absent five
minutes getting the ice-water. Florence felt that her
guests had been outraged, and promised to find out
the wretch, and punish him or her in the most terrible
manner. So the irate young ladies ate their lunch
before it cooled, but forgot to criticise the dishes, so
full were they of wonder at this daring deed. They
were just beginning to calm down, when a loud sneeze
caused a general rush toward the sofa that stood in a
recess of the dining room. A small boy, nearly suffocated
with suppressed laughter, and dust, was dragged
forth and put on trial without a moment's delay.
Florence was judge, the others jury, and the unhappy
youth being penned in a corner, was ordered to tell
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, on penalty of a sound whipping with the big
Japanese war-fan that hung on the wall over his
head.</p>

<p>Vainly trying to suppress his giggles, Phil faced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
seven ladies like a man, and told as little as possible,
delighting to torment them, like a true boy.</p>

<p>"Do you know who put those cards there?"</p>

<p>"Don't you wish <i>you</i> did?"</p>

<p>"Phil Gordon, answer at once."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"Was it Alf? He's at home Saturdays, and
it's just like a horrid Harvard Soph to plague us
so."</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;not."</p>

<p>"Did you see it done?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Man, or woman? Mary fibs, and may have been
bribed."</p>

<p>"Man," with a chuckle of great glee.</p>

<p>"Do I know him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you!"</p>

<p>"Edith's brother Rex?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Do be a good boy, and tell us. We won't scold,
though it was a very, very rude thing to do."</p>

<p>"What will you give me?"</p>

<p>"Do you need to be bribed to do your duty?"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess it's no fun to hide in that stuffy
place, and smell nice grub, and see you tuck away
without offering a fellow a taste. Give me a good go
at the lunch, and I'll see what I can do for you."</p>

<p>"Boys are such pigs! Shall we, girls?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we <i>must</i> know."</p>

<p>"Then go and stuff, you bad boy, but we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
stand guard over you till you tell us who wrote and
put those insulting cards here."</p>

<p>Florence let out the prisoner, and stood by
him while he ate, in a surprisingly short time,
the best of everything on the table, well knowing
that such a rare chance would not soon be his
again.</p>

<p>"Now give me some of that candy, and I'll tell,"
demanded the young Shylock, bound to make the best
of his power while it lasted.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such a little torment? I can't
give the nice bonbons, because we haven't decided
who is to have them."</p>

<p>"Never mind. Pick out a few and get rid of him,"
cried the girls, hovering round their prey, and longing
to shake the truth out of him.</p>

<p>A handful of sweeties were reluctantly bestowed,
and then all waited for the name of the evil-doer with
breathless interest.</p>

<p>"Well," began Phil, with exasperating slowness,
"Alf wrote the cards, and gave me half a dollar to
put 'em round. Made a nice thing of it, haven't I?"
and before one of the girls could catch him he had
bolted from the room, with one hand full of candy, the
other of mince-pie, and his face shining with the triumphant
glee of a small boy who has teased seven big
girls, and got the better of them.</p>

<p>What went on just after that is not recorded, though
Phil peeped in at the windows, hooted through the
slide, and beat a tattoo on the various doors. The
opportune arrival of his mother sent him whooping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
down the street, and the distressed damsels finished
their lunch with what appetite they could.</p>

<p>Edith got the prize, for her pie was pronounced a
grand success, and partaken of so copiously that several
young ladies had reason to think it well named
"Nightmare" by the derisive Alfred. Emboldened
by her success, Edith invited them all to her house on
the next Saturday, and suggested that she and her
cousin provide the lunch, as they had some new
dishes to offer, not down in the receipt-book they had
been studying all winter.</p>

<p>As the ardor of the young cooks was somewhat
damped by various failures, and the discovery that
good cooking is an art not easily learned, anything
in the way of novelty was welcome; and the girls
gladly accepted the invitation, feeling a sense of relief
at the thought of not having any dish to worry about,
though not one of them owned that she was tired of
"messing," as the disrespectful boys called it.</p>

<p>It was unanimously decided to wither with silent
scorn the audacious Alfred and his ally, Rex, while
Phil was to be snubbed by his sister till he had
begged pardon for his share of the evil deed. Then,
having sweetened their tongues and tempers with the
delicious bonbons, the girls departed, feeling that the
next lunch would be an event of unusual interest.</p>

<p>The idea of it originated in a dinner which Patty
got one day, when Nancy, who wanted a holiday, was
unexpectedly called away to the funeral of a cousin,&mdash;the
fifth relative who had died in a year, such was the
mortality in the jovial old creature's family. Edith's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
mother was very busy with a dressmaker, and gladly
accepted the offer the girls made to get dinner alone.</p>

<p>"No fancy dishes, if you please; the boys come
in as hungry as hunters, and want a good solid meal;
so get something wholesome and plain, and plenty of
it," was the much-relieved lady's only suggestion, as
she retired to the sewing-room and left the girls to
keep house in their own way.</p>

<p>"Now, Edie, you be the mistress and give your
orders, and I'll be cook. Only have things that go
well together,&mdash;not all baked or all boiled, because
there isn't room enough on the range, you know;"
said Patty, putting on a big apron with an air of
great satisfaction; for she loved to cook, and was tired
of doing nothing.</p>

<p>"I'll watch all you do, and learn; so that the next
time Nancy goes off in a hurry, I can take her place,
and not have to give the boys what they hate,&mdash;a
picked-up dinner," answered Edith, pleased with her
part, yet a little mortified to find how few plain things
she could make well.</p>

<p>"What do the boys like?" asked Patty, longing
to please them, for they all were very kind to her.</p>

<p>"Roast beef, and custard pudding, with two or
three kinds of vegetables. Can we do all that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. I'll make the pudding right away,
and have it baked before the meat goes in. I can
cook as many vegetables as you please, and soup too."</p>

<p>So the order was given and all went well, if one
might judge by the sounds of merriment in the
kitchen. Patty made her best gingerbread, and
cooked some apples with sugar and spice for tea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and at the stroke of two had a nice dinner smoking
on the table, to the great contentment of the hungry
boys, who did eat like hunters, and advised mamma
to send old Nancy away and keep Patty for cook;
which complimentary but rash proposal pleased their
cousin very much.</p>

<p>"Now this is useful cookery, and well done, though
it looks so simple. Any girl can learn how and be
independent of servants, if need be. Drop your class,
Edith, and take a few lessons of Patty. That would
suit me better than French affairs, that are neither
economical nor wholesome."</p>

<p>"I will, mamma, for I'm tired of creaming butter,
larding things, and beating eggs. These dishes are
not so elegant, but we must have them; so I may as
well learn, if Pat will teach me."</p>

<p>"With pleasure, all I know. Mother thinks it a
very important part of a girl's education; for if you
can't keep servants you can do your own work well,
and if you are rich you are not so dependent as an
ignorant lady is. All kinds of useful sewing and
housework come first with us, and the accomplishments
afterward, as time and money allow."</p>

<p>"That sort of thing turns out the kind of girl I
like, and so does every sensible fellow. Good luck
to you, cousin, and my best thanks for a capital
dinner and a wise little lecture for dessert."</p>

<p>Rex made his best bow as he left the table, and
Patty colored high with pleasure at the praise of the
tall collegian.</p>

<p>Out of this, and the talk the ladies had afterward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
grew the lunch which Edith proposed, and to the
preparation of which went much thought and care; for
the girls meant to have many samples of country fare,
so that various tastes might be pleased. The plan
gradually grew as they worked, and a little surprise
was added, which was a great success.</p>

<p>When Saturday came the younger boys were all
packed off for a holiday in the country, that the coast
might be clear.</p>

<p>"No hiding under sofas in my house, no meddling
with my dinner, if you please, gentlemen," said Edith,
as she saw the small brothers safely off, and fell to
work with Patty and the maid to arrange the dining-room
to suit the feast about to be spread there.</p>

<p>As antique furniture is the fashion now-a-days, it
was easy to collect all the old tables, chairs, china, and
ornaments in the house, and make a pleasant place of
the sunny room where a tall clock always stood; and
damask hangings a century old added much to the
effect. A massive mahogany table was set forth with
ancient silver, glass, china, and all sorts of queer old
salt-cellars, pepper-pots, pickle-dishes, knives, and
spoons. High-backed chairs stood round it, and the
guests were received by a very pretty old lady in
plum-colored satin, with a muslin pelerine, and a large
lace cap most becoming to the rosy face it surrounded.
A fat watch ticked in the wide belt, mitts covered the
plump hands, and a reticule hung at the side. Madam's
daughter, in a very short-waisted pink silk gown,
muslin apron, and frill, was even prettier than her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
mother, for her dark, curly hair hung on her shoulders,
and a little cap was stuck on the top, with long pink
streamers. Her mitts went to the elbow, and a pink
sash was tied in a large bow behind. Black satin
shoes covered her feet, and a necklace of gold beads
was round her throat.</p>

<p>Great was the pleasure this little surprise gave
the girls, and gay was the chatter that went on as
they were welcomed by the hostesses, who constantly
forgot their parts. Madam frisked now and then, and
"Pretty Peggy" was so anxious about dinner that she
was not as devoted to her company as a well-bred
young lady should be. But no one minded, and when
the bell rang, all gathered about the table eager to see
what the feast was to be.</p>

<p>"Ladies, we have endeavored to give you a taste of
some of the good old dishes rather out of fashion now,"
said Madam, standing at her place, with a napkin
pinned over the purple dress, and a twinkle in the
blue eyes under the wide cap-frills. "We thought it
would be well to introduce some of them to the class
and to our family cooks, who either scorn the plain
dishes, or don't know how to cook them <i>well</i>. There
is a variety, and we hope all will find something to
enjoy. Peggy, uncover, and let us begin."</p>

<p>At first the girls looked a little disappointed, for
the dishes were not very new to them; but when they
tasted a real "boiled dinner," and found how good it
was; also baked beans, neither hard, greasy, nor burnt;
beefsteak, tender, juicy, and well flavored; potatoes,
mealy in spite of the season; Indian pudding, made as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
few modern cooks know how to do it; brown bread,
with home-made butter; and pumpkin-pie that cut
like wedges of vegetable gold,&mdash;they changed their
minds, and began to eat with appetites that would
have destroyed their reputations as delicate young
ladies, if they had been seen. Tea in egg-shell cups,
election-cake and cream-cheese with fruit ended the
dinner; and as they sat admiring the tiny old spoons,
the crisp cake, and the little cheeses like snow-balls,
Edith said, in reply to various compliments paid
her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us give honor where honor is due. Patty
suggested this, and did most of the cooking; so thank
her, and borrow her receipt-book. It's very funny,
ever so old, copied and tried by her grandmother, and
full of directions for making quantities of nice things,
from pie like this to a safe, sure wash for the complexion.
May-dew, rose-leaves, and lavender,&mdash;doesn't
that sound lovely?"</p>

<p>"Let me copy it," cried several girls afflicted with
freckles, or sallow with too much coffee and confectionery.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. But I was going to say, as we have
no prize to-day, we have prepared a little souvenir of
our old-fashioned dinner for each of you. Bring them,
daughter; I hope the ladies will pardon the homeliness
of the offering, and make use of the hint that
accompanies each."</p>

<p>As Edith spoke, with a comical mingling of the
merry girl and the stately old lady she was trying to
personate, Patty brought from the side-board, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
it had stood covered up, a silver salver on which lay
five dainty little loaves of bread; on the top of each
appeared a receipt for making the same, nicely written
on colored cards, and held in place by a silver scarf-pin.</p>

<p>"How cunning!" "What lovely pins!" "I'll take
the hint and learn to make good bread at once." "It
smells as sweet as a nut, and isn't hard or heavy a
bit." "Such a pretty idea, and so clever of you to
carry it out so well."</p>

<p>These remarks went on as the little loaves went
round, each girl finding her pin well suited to her pet
fancy or foible; for all were different, and all very
pretty, whether the design was a palette, a skate, a
pen, a racquet, a fan, a feather, a bar of music, or a
daisy.</p>

<p>Seeing that her dinner was a success in spite of its
homeliness, Edith added the last surprise, which had
also been one to Patty and herself when it arrived,
just in time to be carried out. She forgot to be
Madam now, and said with a face full of mingled
merriment and satisfaction, as she pushed her cap
askew and pulled off her mitts:</p>

<p>"Girls, the best joke of all is, that Rex and Alf
sent the pins, and made Phil bring them with a most
humble apology for their impertinence last week. A
meeker boy I never saw, and for that we may thank
Floy; but I think the dinner Pat and I got the other
day won Rex's heart, so that he made Alf eat humble
pie in this agreeable manner. We won't say anything
about it, but all wear our pins and show the boys that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
can forgive and forget as "sweet girls" should, though
we do cook and have ideas of our own beyond looking
pretty and minding our older brothers."</p>

<p>"We will!" cried the chorus with one voice, and
Florence added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I also propose that when we have learned to make
something beside 'kickshaws,' as the boys call our
fancy dishes, we have a dinner like this, and invite
those rascals to it; which will be heaping coals of fire
on their heads, and stopping their mouths forevermore
from making jokes about our cooking-class."</p>

<p>Tramp, tramp, tramp! that was the boys going
down stairs in a hurry.</p>

<p>Bump, bump! that was the bicycle being zigzagged
through the hall.</p>

<p>Bang! that was the front door slamming behind
both boys and bicycle, leaving the house quiet for a
time, though the sound of voices outside suggested
that a lively discussion was going on.</p>

<p>The bicycle fever had reached Perryville, and raged
all summer. Now the town was very like a once
tranquil pool infested with the long-legged water bugs
that go skating over its surface in all directions; for
wheels of every kind darted to and fro, startling
horses, running over small children, and pitching their
riders headlong in the liveliest manner. Men left
their business to see the lads try new wheels, women
grew skilful in the binding of wounds and the mending
of sorely rent garments, gay girls begged for rides,
standing on the little step behind, and boys clamored
for bicycles that they might join the army of martyrs
to the last craze.</p>

<p>Sidney West was the proud possessor of the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
wheel in town, and displayed his treasure with immense
satisfaction before the admiring eyes of his
mates. He had learned to ride in a city rink, and
flattered himself that he knew all there was to learn,
except those feats which only professional gymnasts
acquire. He mounted with skilful agility, rode with
as much grace as the tread-mill movements of the legs
permit, and managed to guide his tall steed without
much danger to himself or others. The occasional
headers he took, and the bruises which kept his manly
limbs in a chronic state of mourning he did not mention;
but concealed his stiffness heroically, and bound
his younger brother to eternal silence by the bribe of
occasional rides on the old wheel.</p>

<p>Hugh was a loyal lad, and regarded his big brother
as the most remarkable fellow in the world; so he forgave
Sid's domineering ways, was a willing slave, a devoted
admirer, and a faithful imitator of all the
masculine virtues, airs, and graces of this elder brother.
On one point only did they disagree, and that was
Sid's refusal to give Hugh the old wheel when the new
one came. Hugh had fondly hoped it would be his,
hints to that effect having been dropped when Sid
wanted an errand done, and for weeks the younger
boy had waited and labored patiently, sure that his
reward would be the small bicycle on which he could
proudly take his place as a member of the newly formed
club; with them to set forth, in the blue uniform, with
horns blowing, badges glittering, and legs flying, for a
long spin,&mdash;to return after dark, a mysterious line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
tall shadows, "with lanterns dimly burning," and
warning whistles sounding as they went.</p>

<p>Great, therefore, was his disappointment and wrath
when he discovered that Sid had agreed to sell the
wheel to another fellow, if it suited him, leaving poor
Hugh the only boy of his set without a machine.
Much as he loved Sid, he could not forgive this underhand
and mercenary transaction. It seemed so
unbrotherly to requite such long and willing service,
to dash such ardent hopes, to betray such blind
confidence, for filthy lucre; and when the deed
was done, to laugh, and ride gayly away on the
splendid British Challenge, the desire of all hearts
and eyes.</p>

<p>This morning Hugh had freely vented his outraged
feelings, and Sid had tried to make light of the affair,
though quite conscious that he had been both unkind
and unfair. A bicycle tournament was to take place
in the city, twenty miles away, and the members of the
club were going. Sid, wishing to distinguish himself,
intended to ride thither, and was preparing for the
long trip with great care. Hugh was wild to go, but
having spent his pocket-money and been forbidden to
borrow, he could not take the cars as the others had
done; no horse was to be had, and their own stud
consisted of an old donkey, who would have been hopeless
even with the inducement offered in the immortal
ditty,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If I had a donkey what wouldn't go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do you think I'd whip him? Oh, no, no!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd take him to Jarley's Wax-work Show."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<p>Therefore poor Hugh was in a desperate state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
mind as he sat on the gate-post watching Sid make
his pet's toilet, till every plated handle, rod, screw,
and axle shone like silver.</p>

<p>"I know I could have ridden the Star if you
hadn't let Joe have it. I do think it was right down
mean of you; so does Aunt Ruth, and father too,&mdash;only
he wont say so, because men always stand by
one another, and snub boys."</p>

<p>This was strong language for gentle Hugh, but he
felt that he must vent his anguish in some way or
cry like a girl; and that disgrace must be avoided,
even if he failed in respect to his elders.</p>

<p>Sid was whistling softly as he oiled and rubbed,
but he was not feeling as easy as he looked, and
heartily wished that he had not committed himself to
Joe, for it would have been pleasant to take "the
little chap," as he called the fourteen-year-older,
along with him, and do the honors of the rink on
this great occasion. Now it was too late; so he
affected a careless air, and added insult to injury by
answering his brother's reproaches in the joking spirit
which is peculiarly exasperating at such moments.</p>

<p>"Children shouldn't play with matches, nor small
boys with bicycles. I don't want to commit murder,
and I certainly should if I let you try to ride twenty
miles when you can't go one without nearly breaking
your neck, or your knees," and Sid glanced with
a smile at the neat darns which ornamented his
brother's trousers over those portions of his long
legs.</p>

<p>"How's a fellow going to learn if he isn't allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
try? Might as well tell me to keep away from the
water till I can swim. You give me a chance and
see if I can't ride as well as some older fellows who
have been pitched round pretty lively before <i>they</i>
dared to try a twenty-mile spin," answered Hugh,
clapping both hands on his knees to hide the tell-tale
darns.</p>

<p>"If Joe doesn't want it, you can use the old wheel
till I decide what to do with it. I suppose a man
has a right to sell his own property if he likes," said
Sid, rather nettled at the allusion to his own tribulations
in times past.</p>

<p>"Of course he has; but if he's promised to give a
thing he ought to do it, and not sneak out of the
bargain after he's got lots of work done to pay for it.
That's what makes me mad; for I believed you and
depended on it, and it hurts me more to have you
deceive me than it would to lose ten bicycles;" and
Hugh choked a little at the thought, in spite of his
attempt to look sternly indignant.</p>

<p>"You are welcome to your opinion, but I wouldn't
cry about it. Play with chaps of your own size and
don't hanker after men's property. Take the cars, if
you want to go so much, and stop bothering me,"
retorted Sid, getting cross because he was in the
wrong and wouldn't own it.</p>

<p>"You know I can't! No money, and mustn't
borrow. What's the use of twitting a fellow like
that?" and Hugh with great difficulty refrained from
knocking off the new helmet-hat which was close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
his foot as Sid bent to inspect the shining hub of the
cherished wheel.</p>

<p>"Take Sancho, then; you might arrive before the
fun was all over, if you carried whips and pins and
crackers enough to keep the old boy going; you'd
be a nice span."</p>

<p>This allusion to the useless donkey was cruel, but
Hugh held on to the last remnant of his temper,
and made a wild proposal in the despair of the
moment.</p>

<p>"Don't be a donkey yourself. See here, why can't
we ride and tie? I've tried this wheel, and got on
tip-top. You'd be along to see to me, and we'd take
turns. Do, Sid! I want to go awfully, and if you
only will I won't say another word about Joe."</p>

<p>But Sid only burst out laughing at the plan, in the
most heartless manner.</p>

<p>"No, thank you. I don't mean to walk a step
when I can ride; or lend my new wheel to a chap who
can hardly keep right side up on the old one. It
looks like a jolly plan to you, I dare say, but <i>I</i> don't
see it, young man."</p>

<p>"I hope <i>I</i> sha'n't be a selfish brute when I'm
seventeen. I'll have a bicycle yet,&mdash;A, No. 1,&mdash;and
then you'll see how I'll lend it, like a gentleman,
and not insult other fellows because they happen to
be two or three years younger."</p>

<p>"Keep cool, my son, and don't call names. If you
are such a smart lad, why don't you walk, since wheels
and horses and donkey fail. It's <i>only</i> twenty miles,&mdash;nothing
to speak of, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, I could do it if I liked. I've walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
eighteen, and wasn't half so tired as you were. Any
one can get over the ground on a bicycle, but it takes
strength and courage to keep it up on foot."</p>

<p>"Better try it."</p>

<p>"I will, some day."</p>

<p>"Don't crow too loud, my little rooster; you are
not cock of the walk yet."</p>

<p>"If I was, I wouldn't hit a fellow when he's down;"
and fearing he should kick over the tall bicycle that
stood so temptingly near him, Hugh walked away,
trying to whistle, though his lips were more inclined
to tremble than to pucker.</p>

<p>"Just bring my lunch, will you? Auntie is putting
it up; I must be off," called Sid, so used to giving
orders that he did so even at this unpropitious
moment.</p>

<p>"Get it yourself. I'm not going to slave for you
any longer, old tyrant," growled Hugh; for the trodden
worm turned at last, as worms will.</p>

<p>This was open revolt, and Sid felt that things were
in a bad way, but would not stop to mend them
then.</p>

<p>"Whew! here's a tempest in a teapot. Well, it
is too bad; but I can't help it now. I'll make it all
right to-morrow, and bring him round with a nice
account of the fun. Hullo, Bemis! going to town?"
he called, as a neighbor came spinning noiselessly by.</p>

<p>"Part way, and take the cars at Lawton. It's hard
riding over the hills, and a bother to steer a wheel
through the streets. Come on, if you're ready."</p>

<p>"All right;" and springing up, Sid was off, forgetting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
all about the lunch.</p>

<p>Hugh, dodging behind the lilac-bushes, heard what
passed, and the moment they were gone ran to the
gate to watch them out of sight with longing eyes,
then turned away, listlessly wondering how he should
spend the holiday his brother was going to enjoy so
much.</p>

<p>At that moment Aunt Ruth hurried to the door,
waving the leathern pouch well stored with cake and
sandwiches, cold coffee and pie.</p>

<p>"Sid's forgotten his bag. Run, call, stop him!"
she cried, trotting down the walk with her cap-strings
waving wildly in the fresh October wind.</p>

<p>For an instant Hugh hesitated, thinking sullenly,
"Serves him right. I won't run after him;" then his
kind heart got the better of his bad humor, and catching
up the bag he raced down the road at his best
pace, eager to heap coals of fire on Sid's proud head,&mdash;to
say nothing of his own desire to see more of the
riders.</p>

<p>"They will have to go slowly up the long hill, and
I'll catch them then," he thought as he tore over
the ground, for he was a good runner and prided
himself on his strong legs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for his amiable intentions, the boys
had taken a short cut to avoid the hill, and were out
of sight down a lane where Hugh never dreamed they
would dare to go, so mounted.</p>

<p>"Well, they have done well to get over the hill at
this rate. Guess they won't keep it up long," panted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Hugh, stopping short when he saw no signs of the
riders.</p>

<p>The road stretched invitingly before him, the race
had restored his spirits, and curiosity to see what had
become of his friends lured him to the hill-top, where
temptation sat waiting for him. Up he trudged,
finding the fresh air, the sunny sky, the path strewn
with red and yellow leaves, and the sense of freedom
so pleasant that when he reached the highest point
and saw the world all before him, as it were, a daring
project seemed to flash upon him, nearly taking his
breath away with its manifold delights.</p>

<p>"Sid said, 'Walk,' and why not?&mdash;at least to
Lawton, and take the cars from there, as Bemis means
to do. Wouldn't the old fellows be surprised to see
me turn up at the rink? It's quarter past eight now,
and the fun begins at three; I could get there easy
enough, and by Jupiter, I will! Got lunch all here,
and money enough to pay this car-fare, I guess. If
I haven't, I'll go a little further and take a horse-car.
What a lark! here goes,"&mdash;and with a whoop
of boyish delight at breaking bounds, away went
Hugh down the long hill, like a colt escaped from its
pasture.</p>

<p>The others were just ahead, but the windings of the
road hid them from him; so all went on, unconscious
of each other's proximity. Hugh's run gave him a
good start, and he got over the ground famously for
five or six miles; then he went more slowly, thinking
he had plenty of time to catch a certain train. But
he had no watch, and when he reached Lawton he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the pleasure of seeing the cars go out at one end of
the station as he hurried in at the other.</p>

<p>"I won't give it up, but just go on and do it afoot.
That will be something to brag of when the other chaps
tell big stories. I'll see how fast I can go, for I'm
not tired, and can eat on the way. Much obliged to
Sid for a nice lunch."</p>

<p>And chuckling over this piece of good luck, Hugh
set out again, only pausing for a good drink at the
town-pump. The thirteen miles did not seem very
long when he thought of them, but as he walked them
they appeared to grow longer and longer, till he felt
as if he must have travelled about fifty. He was in
good practice, and fortunately had on easy shoes; but
he was in such a hurry to make good time that he
allowed himself no rest, and jogged on, up hill and
down, with the resolute air of one walking for a wager.
There we will leave him, and see what had befallen Sid;
for his adventures were more exciting than Hugh's,
though all seemed plain sailing when he started.</p>

<p>At Lawton he had parted from his friend and gone
on alone, having laid in a store of gingerbread from
a baker's cart, and paused to eat, drink, and rest by
a wayside brook. A few miles further he passed a
party of girls playing lawn tennis, and as he slowly
rolled along regarding them from his lofty perch, one
suddenly exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, it's our neighbor, Sidney West! How did <i>he</i>
come here?" and waving her racquet, Alice ran across
the lawn to find out.</p>

<p>Very willing to stop and display his new uniform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
which was extremely becoming, Sid dismounted, doffed
his helmet, and smiled upon the damsels, leaning over
the hedge like a knight of old.</p>

<p>"Come in and play a game, and have some lunch.
You will have plenty of time, and some of us are going
to the rink by and by. Do, we want a boy to help us,
for Maurice is too lazy, and Jack has hurt his hand
with that stupid base ball," said Alice, beckoning persuasively,
while the other girls nodded and smiled
hopefully.</p>

<p>Thus allured, the youthful Ulysses hearkened to the
voice of the little Circe in a round hat, and entered
the enchanted grove, to forget the passage of time
as he disported himself among the nymphs. He was
not changed to a beast, as in the immortal story,
though the three young gentlemen did lie about the
lawn in somewhat grovelling attitudes; and Alice
waved her racquet as if it were a wand, while her
friends handed glasses of lemonade to the recumbent
heroes during pauses in the game.</p>

<p>While thus blissfully engaged, time slipped away,
and Hugh passed him in the race, quite unconscious
that his brother was reposing in the tent that looked
so inviting as the dusty, tired boy plodded by, counting
every mile-stone with increasing satisfaction.</p>

<p>"If I get to Uncle Tim's by one o'clock, I shall
have done very well. Four miles an hour is a fair
pace, and only one stop. I'll telegraph to auntie as
soon as I arrive; but she won't worry, she's used to
having us turn up all right when we get ready,"
thought Hugh, grateful that no over-anxious mamma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
was fretting about his long absence. The boys had
no mother, and Aunt Ruth was an easy old lady who
let them do as they liked, to their great contentment.</p>

<p>As he neared his journey's end our traveller's spirits
rose, and the blisters on his heels were forgotten in
the dramatic scene his fancy painted, when Sid should
discover him at Uncle Tim's, or calmly seated at the
rink. Whistling gayly, he was passing through a
wooded bit of road when the sound of voices made him
look back to see a carriage full of girls approaching,
escorted by a bicycle rider, whose long blue legs
looked strangely familiar.</p>

<p>Anxious to keep his secret till the last moment,
also conscious that he was not in company trim, Hugh
dived into the wood, out of sight, while the gay party
went by, returning to the road as soon as they were
hidden by a bend.</p>

<p>"If Sid hadn't been so mean, I should have been
with him, and had some of the fun. I don't feel like
forgiving him in a hurry for making me foot it, like a
tramp, while he is having such a splendid time."</p>

<p>If Hugh could have known what was to happen
very soon after he had muttered these words to himself,
as he wiped his hot face, and took the last sip of
the coffee to quench his thirst, he would have been sorry
he uttered them, and have forgiven his brother everything.</p>

<p>While he was slowly toiling up the last long hill,
Sid was coasting down on the other side, eager to display
his courage and skill before the girls,&mdash;being of an
age when boys begin to wish to please and astonish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the gentler creatures whom they have hitherto treated
with indifference or contempt. It was a foolish thing
to do, for the road was rough, with steep banks on
either side, and a sharp turn at the end; but Sid
rolled gayly along, with an occasional bump, till a
snake ran across the road, making the horse shy, the
girls scream, the rider turn to see what was the matter,
and in doing so lose his balance just when a large
stone needed to be avoided. Over went Sid, down
rattled the wheel, up rose a cloud of dust, and sudden
silence fell upon the girls at sight of this disaster.
They expected their gallant escort would spring up
and laugh over his accident; but when he remained
flat upon his back, where he had alighted after a somersault,
with the bicycle spread over him like a pall,
they were alarmed, and flew to the rescue.</p>

<p>A cut on the forehead was bleeding, and the blow
had evidently stunned him for a moment. Luckily, a
house was near, and a man seeing the accident hastened
to offer more efficient help than any the girls had
wit enough to give in the first flurry, as all four only
flapped wildly at Sid with their handkerchiefs, and exclaimed
excitedly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What shall we do? Is he dead? Run for water.
Call somebody, quick."</p>

<p>"Don't be scat, gals; it takes a sight of thumpin' to
break a boy's head. He ain't hurt much; kinder
dazed for a minute. I'll hist up this pesky mashine
and set him on his legs, if he hain't damaged 'em."</p>

<p>With these cheering words, the farmer cleared away
the ruins, and propped the fallen rider against a tree;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
which treatment had such a good effect that Sid was
himself in a moment, and much disgusted to find
what a scrape he was in.</p>

<p>"This is nothing, a mere bump; quite right, thanks.
Let us go on at once; so sorry to alarm you, ladies."
He began his polite speech bravely, but ended with a
feeble smile and a clutch at the tree, suddenly turning
sick and dizzy again.</p>

<p>"You come along a me. I'll tinker you and your
whirligig up, young man. No use sayin' go ahead, for
the thing is broke, and you want to keep quiet for a
spell. Drive along, gals, I'll see to him; and my old
woman can nuss him better 'n a dozen flutterin' young
things scat half to death."</p>

<p>Taking matters into his own hands, the farmer had
boy and bicycle under his roof in five minutes; and
with vain offers of help, many regrets, and promises to
let his Uncle Tim know where he was, in case he did
not arrive, the girls reluctantly drove away, leaving
no sign of the catastrophe except the trampled road,
and a dead snake.</p>

<p>Peace was hardly restored when Hugh came down
the hill, little dreaming what had happened, and for
the second time passed his brother, who just then was
lying on a sofa in the farm-house, while a kind old
woman adorned his brow with a large black plaster, suggesting
brown paper steeped in vinegar, for the various
bruises on his arms and legs.</p>

<p>"Some one killed the snake and made a great fuss
about it, I should say," thought Hugh, observing the
signs of disorder in the dust; but, resisting a boy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
interest in such affairs, he stoutly tramped on, sniffing
the whiffs of sea air that now and then saluted
his nose, telling him that he was nearing his much-desired
goal.</p>

<p>Presently the spires of the city came in sight, to
his great satisfaction, and only the long bridge and
a street or two lay between him and Uncle Tim's
easy chair, into which he soon hoped to cast himself.</p>

<p>Half-way across the bridge a farm-wagon passed,
with a bicycle laid carefully on the barrels of vegetables
going to market. Hugh gazed affectionately
at it, longing to borrow it for one brief, delicious spin
to the bridge end. Had he known that it was Sid's
broken wheel, going to be repaired without loss of
time, thanks to the good farmer's trip to town, he
would have paused to have a hearty laugh, in spite
of his vow not to stop till his journey was over.</p>

<p>Just as Hugh turned into the side street where Uncle
Tim lived, a horse-car went by, in one corner of which
sat a pale youth, with a battered hat drawn low over
his eyes, who handed out his ticket with the left hand,
and frowned when the car jolted, as if the jar hurt
him. Had he looked out of the window, he would
have seen a very dusty boy, with a pouch over his
shoulder, walking smartly down the street where his
relation lived. But Sid carefully turned his head
aside, fearing to be recognized; for he was on his way
to a certain club to which Bemis belonged, preferring
his sympathy and hospitality to the humiliation of
having his mishap told at home by Uncle Tim, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
would be sure to take Hugh's part, and exult over the
downfall of the proud. Well for him that he avoided
that comfortable mansion; for on the door-steps stood
Hugh, beaming with satisfaction as the clock struck
one, proclaiming that he had done his twenty miles
in a little less than five hours.</p>

<p>"Not bad for a 'little chap,' even though he is 'a
donkey,'" chuckled the boy, dusting his shoes, wiping
his red face, and touching himself up as well as he
could, in order to present as fresh and unwearied an
aspect as possible, when he burst upon his astonished
brother's sight.</p>

<p>In he marched when the door opened, to find his
uncle and two rosy cousins just sitting down to dinner.
Always glad to see the lads, they gave him a cordial
welcome, and asked for his brother.</p>

<p>"Hasn't he come yet?" cried Hugh, surprised, yet
glad to be the first on the field.</p>

<p>Nothing had been seen of him, and Hugh at once
told his tale, to the great delight of his jolly uncle, and
the admiring wonder of Meg and May, the rosy young
cousins. They all enjoyed the exploit immensely,
and at once insisted that the pedestrian should be refreshed
by a bath, a copious meal, and a good rest in the
big chair, where he repeated his story by particular
request.</p>

<p>"You deserve a bicycle, and you shall have one, as
sure as my name is Timothy West. I like pluck and
perseverance, and you've got both; so come on, my
boy, and name the wheel you like best. Sid needs
a little taking down, as you lads say, and this will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
give it to him, I fancy. I'm a younger brother myself,
and I know what their trials are."</p>

<p>As his uncle made these agreeable remarks, Hugh
looked as if <i>his</i> trials were all over; for his face shone
with soap and satisfaction, his hunger was quenched
by a splendid dinner, his tired feet luxuriated in a
pair of vast slippers, and the blissful certainty of
owning a first-class bicycle filled his cup to overflowing.
Words could hardly express his gratitude, and
nothing but the hope of meeting Sid with this glorious
news would have torn him from the reposeful
Paradise where he longed to linger. Pluck and
perseverance, with cold cream on the blistered heels,
got him into his shoes again, and he rode away
in a horse-car, as in a triumphal chariot, to find his
brother.</p>

<p>"I won't brag, but I do feel immensely tickled at
this day's work. Wonder how he got on. Did it in
two or three hours, I suppose, and is parading round
with those swell club fellows at the rink. I'll slip
in and let him find me, as if I wasn't a bit proud of
what I've done, and didn't care two pins for anybody's
praise."</p>

<p>With this plan in his head, Hugh enjoyed the afternoon
very much; keeping a sharp lookout for Sid,
even while astonishing feats were being performed
before his admiring eyes. But nowhere did he see
his brother; for he was searching for a blue uniform
and a helmet with a certain badge on it, while Sid
in a borrowed hat and coat sat in a corner looking on,
whenever a splitting headache and the pain in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
bones allowed him to see and enjoy the exploits in
which he had hoped to join.</p>

<p>Not until it was over did the brothers meet, as they
went out, and then the expression on Sid's face was so
comical that Hugh laughed till the crowd about them
stared, wondering what the joke could be.</p>

<p>"How in the world did <i>you</i> get here?" asked the
elder boy, giving his hat a sudden pull to hide the
plaster.</p>

<p>"Walked, as you advised me to."</p>

<p>Words cannot express the pleasure that answer gave
Hugh, or the exultation he vainly tried to repress, as
his eyes twinkled and a grin of real boyish fun shone
upon his sunburnt countenance.</p>

<p>"You expect me to believe that, do you?"</p>

<p>"Just as you please. I started to catch you with
your bag, and when I missed you, thought I might as
well keep on. Got in about one, had dinner at uncle's,
and been enjoying these high jinks ever since."</p>

<p>"Very well, for a beginning. Keep it up and you'll
be a Rowell by and by. What do you suppose father
will say to you, small boy?"</p>

<p>"Not much. Uncle will make that all right. <i>He</i>
thought it was a plucky thing to do, and so did the girls.
When did you get in?" asked Hugh, rather nettled at
Sid's want of enthusiasm, though it was evident he
was much impressed by the "small boy's" prank.</p>

<p>"I took it easy after Bemis left me. Had a game
of tennis at the Blanchards' as I came along, dinner at
the club, and strolled up here with the fellows. Got
a headache, and don't feel up to much."</p>

<p>As Sid spoke and Hugh's keen eye took in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
various signs of distress which betrayed a hint of the
truth, the grin changed to a hearty "Ha! ha!" as he
smote his knees exclaiming gleefully, "You've come
to grief! I know it, I see it. Own up, and don't shirk,
for I'll find it out somehow, as sure as you live."</p>

<p>"Don't make such a row in the street. Get aboard
this car and I'll tell you, for you'll give me no peace
till I do," answered Sid, well knowing that Alice would
never keep the secret.</p>

<p>To say that it was "nuts" to Hugh faintly expresses
the interest he took in the story which was
extracted bit by bit from the reluctant sufferer; but
after a very pardonable crow over the mishaps of his
oppressor, he yielded to the sympathy he felt for his
brother, and was very good to him.</p>

<p>This touched Sid, and filled him with remorse for
past unkindness; for one sees one's faults very plainly,
and is not ashamed to own it, when one is walking
through the Valley of Humiliation.</p>

<p>"Look here, I'll tell you what I'll do," he
said, as they left the car, and Hugh offered an
arm, with a friendly air pleasant to see. "I'll give
you the old wheel, and let Joe get another where
he can. It's small for him, and I doubt if he wants
it, any way. I do think you were a plucky fellow
to tramp your twenty miles in good time, and not
bear malice either, so let's say 'Done,' and forgive
and forget."</p>

<p>"Much obliged, but uncle is going to give me a
new one; so Joe needn't be disappointed. I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
how hard that is, and am glad to keep him from it,
for he's poor and can't afford a new one."</p>

<p>That answer was Hugh's only revenge for his own
trials, and Sid felt it, though he merely said, with a
hearty slap on the shoulder,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it. Uncle is a trump, and so are
you. We'll take the last train home, and I'll pay
your fare."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Poor old man, you did get a bump,
didn't you?" exclaimed Hugh, as they took off their
hats in the hall, and the patch appeared in all its
gloomy length and breadth.</p>

<p>"Head will be all right in a day or two, but I
stove in my helmet, and ground a hole in both knees
of my new shorts. Had to borrow a fit-out of Bemis,
and leave my rags behind. We needn't mention any
more than is necessary to the girls; I hate to be
fussed over," answered Sid, trying to speak carelessly.</p>

<p>Hugh had to stop and have another laugh, remembering
the taunts his own mishaps had called forth;
but he did not retaliate, and Sid never forgot it.
Their stay was a short one, and Hugh was the hero
of the hour, quite eclipsing his brother, who usually
took the first place, but now very meekly played
second fiddle, conscious that he was not an imposing
figure, in a coat much too big for him, with a patch
on his forehead, a purple bruise on one cheek, and a
general air of dilapidation very trying to the usually
spruce youth.</p>

<p>When they left, Uncle Tim patted Hugh on the
head,&mdash;a liberty the boy would have resented if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the delightful old gentleman had not followed it up
by saying, with a reckless generosity worthy of
record,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Choose your bicycle, my boy, and send the bill
to me." Then turning to Sid he added, in a tone
that made the pale face redden suddenly, "And do
you remember that the tortoise beat the hare in the
old fable we all know."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"That is the last of the stories, for our holiday is
over, and to-morrow we must go home. We have had
a splendid time, and thank you and auntie so much,
dear grandma," said Min, expressing the feeling of
all the children, as they stood about the fire when the
bicycle tale ended.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad, my darlings, and please God we'll
all meet here again next year, well and happy and
ready for more fun," answered the old lady, with arms
and lap full of loving little people.</p>

<p>"Auntie deserves a vote of thanks, and I rise to
propose it," said Geoff; and it was passed with great
applause.</p>

<p>"Many thanks. If the odds and ends in my portfolio
have given you pleasure or done you any good,
my fondest wishes are gratified," answered Aunt Elinor,
laughing, yet well pleased. "I tucked a moral
in, as we hide pills in jelly, and I hope you didn't
find them hard to swallow."</p>

<p>"Very easy and nice. I intend to look after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
little things faithfully, and tell the girls how to make
their jerseys fit," said Min.</p>

<p>"I'm going to fill my jewel-box as Daisy did, and
learn to cook," added Lotty.</p>

<p>"Eli is the boy for me, and I won't forget to be
kind to <i>my</i> small chap," said Walt, stroking his
younger brother's head with unusual kindness.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm rather mixed in my heroes, but I'll
take the best of Corny, Onawandah, and the banner
fellow for my share," cried Geoff.</p>

<p>The little people proclaimed their favorites; but as
all spoke together, only a comical mixture of doves,
bears, babies, table-cloths and blue hose reached the
ear. Then came the good-night kisses, the patter of
departing feet, and silence fell upon the room. The
little wheel was still, the chairs stood empty, the
old portraits looked sadly down, the fire died out,
and the Spinning-Wheel Stories were done.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
